      "{'inputs.question': 'Dear, Senator\\n\\nThe\\n\\nElectoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.\\n\\nSome things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state\\'s people . Also, the electoral college causes many issues duing the voting period.\\n\\nTo start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state\\'s people must take each year.\\n\\nYou never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn\\'t want. In the article \"The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" Bradford Plumer states \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\" (Plumer Paragraph 10) What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it\\'s time to vote... they decide to switch and choose\\n\\nHILARY CLINTON!\\n\\nMany of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.\\n\\nIf we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn\\'t be so much tension between people.\\n\\nFurthermore, the article \"The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system ae wrong\" Bradford explains \"Back in 1960, Segregationists in the Louisinna legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy.\" This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.\\n\\nThe elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people\\'s vote.\\n\\nAdditionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time,\\n\\nPeople would be let down when they find out that\\xa0 the candidate they had chosen didn\\'t win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.\\n\\nBradford proves this by explaining \"...\\'faithless\\' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" (Plumer Paragraph 11) On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it\\'s selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article \"In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president\" Richard A. Posner exclaims \"The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner.\" (Posner Paragraph 15) What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it\\'s time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.\\n\\nTime has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state\\'s people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example,\\n\\nThe electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the \"Winner-take-all\" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.\\n\\nHowever, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.\\n\\nThere are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons\\n\\nNOT\\n\\nto keep the electoral college in use.\\n\\nLastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state\\'s people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they\\xa0 might have as their new president.\\n\\nAccording to Bradford, the electoral college is \"...Unfair, outdated, and irrational.\" (Plumer paragraph 14) It\\'s about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.

      "{'inputs.question': 'The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.\\n\\nTo commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer\\'s article, \"Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy\" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer\\'s aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state\\'s vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens\\' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn\\'t make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won\\'t allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled \"swing states\". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner\\'s article in favor of this corrupt system, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...\" (21). While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn\\'t a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state\\'s importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation\\'s population, and thus should be replaced.\\n\\nIn retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.       \\xa0    \\xa0    \\xa0       \\xa0    ', 'score': '6', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '664', 'gpt_coherence_y': '5.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

I do believe cars cause a huge disavantage to our clean air but i do not agree with banning people from driving gassed cars, But It would be better for the environment if people would start buying electric cars (hybrid) because some dont run off of gas and some use very little gas. Using these electric cars will benifit everyone because it cost less instead of buying gas and it leaves cleaner air in our environment. Even if lets say forty percent of United States citizens used electric cars that would still leave a huge roll in having cleaner air for us to breath, But if we all do switch to electric cars then cities need to provide cargers for cars like this so that if we are out for a while and our cars battery dies we can charge the car, I think people dont use these cars as much because they think well what happenes if my cars battery dies then there screwed.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Pursuting Venus\\n\\nImagine having a twin, but never knowing anything about your twin due to the dangers they posses. Well, Earth and Venus are a great example of that scenario. Earth being the planet us humans live on everyday of our lives, Venus´s aspects are similar to the ones of Earth´s. Keeping this in mind, Venus has a plentiful amount of dangers that lurk the planet, delaying the exploration of our twin planet. So why does the author suggest that we should pursue exploring Venus? The author belives we should pursue exploring Venus due to the possibility of a crucial planetray vist, being scientifically productive, and overall just having more knowledge of the planet itself.\\n\\nTo begin, if Earth were to ever start to decade and there were still human life, would living on a different planet be an option? Astronomers have conducted studies showing that Venus may have once held life there itself. In paragraph 4, the article states; ¨Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rock sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.¨ This example shows that our Earth has similar factors of that which Venus has. Another example to show that us humans may one day be able to colonize Venus,if the occurence were to happen, is the conditions. In paragraph 5, the article reads; ¨Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.¨ Although the statement claims that the conditions are not easy, they are still bareable to the human population. Summing up, Venus could soon be a home to us, and scientest will soon be able to know whether or not that is possible by exploring Venus.\\n\\nSecondly, the exploration of Venus can provide more scientific facts, proving to be scientifically productive. To do this, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will send humans to collect data. Hostile conditions may play into how we do this, but NASA´s possible solution would allow scientists to exam our sister planet without interfearing with the hazardous conditions. In paragraph 5, the article states; ¨Imagien a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus wpuld avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way.¨ The idea of this hovercraft is based around the already scientfic facts of the planet Venus, such as the temperature and air pressure the hovercraft would be experincing. In paragraph 5, the article reads; ¨...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.¨ Consenquently, the hovercraft could provide more benifical scientific evidence of planet Venus for our astronomers and scientists.\\n\\nLast, but not least, using what we already know about the planet could help NASA and scientists to further explore Venus. Studies conducted to enhance our technology of exploration have shown what Venus could damage. In paragraph 7, the article states; ¨For example, some simlified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus´s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.¨ This exmaple shows what possible scenarios could produce from the pursuit of exploring Venus. The end results will then contribute to greater advancements of that certain technology to one day be able to withstand that conditions of Vneus. Overall, our previous knowledge combined with new facts and information can assist with how NASA and scientists will explore our sister planet.\\n\\nConcluding, the author belives we should pursue exploring Venus due to the possibility of a crucial planetray visit, being scientifically productive, and overall just having more knowledge of the planet itself. The conditions and atmosphere may affect how much we are able to learn and explore, but NASA has innovated new developments to help us explore further.

We are smart enough to realize this though and are trying to fix this problem.\\n\\nIf we limit car usage the death toll will not be as high, death is supposed to be natural, car crashes are becoming natural. Everyday I hear sirens and i assume there has been a car crash, on the radio instead of playing music they have \"stress-saver traffic\" which tells you what major roads are closed because of car crashes. I get using a car if your work is more than 5 miles away, but if you live close why waste the money? or take the risk? We can\\'t be that lazy. Driving cars causes stress too, like road rage. \" \\'When I had a car I was always tense.

What better way to identify a car with less cars on the road? There are benfits everywhere obesity would go down because people would be forced to do some type of excercise to get to their job instead of using a car. In some ways New York, USA has already done this by creating subways. Lots of people use subways to get to their jobs or bikes. Then again it has the most polluted city in the U.S. using subways will reduce that pollution dramatically or just walking somewhere instead of taking a cab.\\n\\nHaving a car-free day would at least open our eyes to the differnce it would make.

      "{'inputs.question': 'The Value of Emotions\\n\\n\"Many teachers cannot tell when a student has something emotionally wrong with them,\" my mom, OTHER_PII, stated. My mom is friends with many teachers and talks to them about their students and how they can tell when something is wrong with a student. In today\\'s society many teachers throughout school corporations struggle with knowing if their is something wrong with their students. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is valuable in the classroom because it can help the teachers understand the students, help know when a student is emotionally not stable, and help the students not get too bored or confused during a lesson.\\n\\nThe FACS is valuable in the classroom for many reasons, including the fact that it will help the teacher understand their students. From a student point of view, many teachers do not understand their students fully when something is wrong. While many kids come to school and look fine, there may be more going on in their home life than a teacher knows about. If the Facial Action Coding System was in place in schools, teachers would be able to find out what emotion the students are feeling and see if they can help them in any way. In Paragraph 4, Dr. Huang states, \"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.\" This explains how the computer will recognize any emotion that the student may have, even if it is not the same as everyone else. The computer system can read your emotions and come up with different advertisements on the screen to make a person happier which would also benefit many people. In paragraph 6, the author states, \"Imagine a computer that knows when you\\'re happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" These computers can read your emotions and change the content on your screen just based on how you reacted to it. The FACS would be valuable in schools because it would help the student be happier while in school and help the teacher recognize what is going on with the student and understand them more.\\n\\nThe Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the schools because it can help the teacher know when a student is not emotionally stable. Many teachers do not realize when their is something wrong with a student and the FACS could help with that. Thousands of students throughout all the schools in America have issues at home and show that at school with how much work they do not participate in and how they treat others at school. There is an underlying issue within the school system because many teachers are not able to recognize when these students have problems and issues like this could lead to more school violence acts. In paragraph 4, the author says, \"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements--in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa.\" The FACS can track any emotion in any person which can be helpful in school because there are many different kids throughout the schools that have different emotions. The computer system can recognize these emotions with the facial movements of a student. In Paragraph 3, D\\'alto states, \" Eckamn has classified six basic emotions--happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness--and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\" Depending on what emotions the students have and how they convey that with facial muslces, the computer can read this and help the student get on the right track and fix that emotion if it is a negative emotion.\\n\\nThe Facial Action Coding System can help recognize if the students are bcoming confused or bored. Many student get distracted, confused, or bored when they are working in class. In Paragraph 6, Huang says, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" This would help the student and teacher because when a student gets bored they automatically stop paying attention and do their own thing, but with the FACS the computer could help them not be confused or catch their attention so they are not bored. In Paragraph 6, the author states, \"It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" The computer system could act as a teacher and help the students if maybe the teacher is busy which would be an advantage to both the teacher and the student. While many people think this would not be valuable because it has no place in the school and would not help anyone, the Facial Action Coding System would not only help many students, but many teachers as well, while not being too invasive.\\n\\nThe Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in schools because it could help the teachers understand their students, it could also help the teacher know when a student is not emotionally stable, and it could help the student with not getting too bored or confused with a lesson. This would be very valuable in schools because of the daily emotions students go through in a school day!

I saw many sights. I saw the excavated castle in Crete and marvled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I also, took a ride on a Gondola in Vencie, Italy a city with streets of water. Like I said these are all wonderfull sights you could see. There is one sight I think was the most special and that was the Acropolis in Greece. Europe and China are a couple other sights. The boat trips do take a while though. For example, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to China. These are many sights that make this program super enteresting and fun.\\n\\nThe next reason I think you should join this program is because it's an opportunity to work hard and show others what we can do. There are many opportunities to do, expecially if you are on the cattle boat. Some of the things to do are, caring for animals, and makeing sure they have been fed and watered, pullying bags of oates and bales of hay from the lower holds of the ship to the upper, and cleaning the stalls. These many things were hard work.\\n\\ncleaning the stalls was every night and the animals had to be checked daily and nightly to make sure none of them were hurt and fed and watered properly. All of these responsabillities are hard work.\\n\\nJust because there's hard work dosen't mean theres not any fun, because there is. once the animals and cargo are all dropped off there is time to have fun on board, The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed.

There is time to goof around and have fun too .\\n\\nLike I had said before, there are many reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join this program because there are so many sights to see on boat trips, it's an opportunity to work hard, and there's time to have fun.

To continue the way the aunth supports the idea is by talking about how NASA is working on studying Venus,How scientists want to discuss further visits, and ways we can study venus without any harm being involved.\\n\\nFisrt reason why is NASA is working on how to study venus. For example, Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulatign the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions(''Paragraph 7''). They are working on all these of projects to see how they could study Venus in a better way. NASA is trying to find ways that They could have less heat to bring someone on the rocketship. This in formation proves that studing venus is not that hard unless you find ways to approatch it more sucessfully.\\n\\nThe second reason why is how the scientist want to discuss about making more visits to Venus. When they are saying that Venus is a Inhospitable. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus it could of been one of the Earth-like planet in the soloar system( ''paragraph 4-5'').There are trying to send people to study venus, but they want to say how it is inhospitable. This information proves on that Venus is something to study about if scientists want to study it then why should we not.\\n\\nThe third reason is ways we could study venus without any harm be involved. Think about a blimp-like vehicle hovering over 30 or so miles above the roling Venusian landscape(''paragraph 5''). If jet planes travel at a higher altitude and avoid storms. If we can get a vehicle to be over Venus, then we could avoid any really hot heat. This information proves that they are ways to study Venus without any harsh harm being involed to the human.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the author has supporting evaluations to studying Venus.

FACS could help teachers understand their students better.\\n\\nFACS would be a good way to tell a child\\'s emotions if they are acting up at school.

If a student is having a rough day the teacher could maybe cheer them up. Most teachers let things slide even though they can read some of their students expressions. Expressions tell it all. FACS could help kids have a better time in school if they were able to have their expressions read so they could talk about why they are feeling a certain way.\\n\\nStudents can sometimes be in a bad mood becuase of things that happen throughout their day.

The Face on Mars was first discovered in 1976, but gained a gargantuan amount of attention in 2001 (paragraph 1). Conspiracy theorists belive that the Face on Mars is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, however this theory is false (paragraph 5). The Face on Mars is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa (paragraph 12). This can be proven by understanding that Martian mesas are common (paragraph 2); realizing that in the 2001 photo if something was near the Face, NASA would have been able to see it\\n\\n(paragraph 11); and acknowledging the fact that the Face on Mars resembles natural structures on Earth (paragraph 12).\\n\\nFirst, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because Martian mesas are common. \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh,\" (paragraph 2). The fact that Martian mesas are common makes the idea of the face on Mars being a natural martian Mesa more logical. This is because there are more natural landforms called Martian Mesas on Mars than just the Face.\\n\\nIn addition, the Face on Mars in a natural landform because in the 2001 NASA photo, if there was Martian life people would have been able to see it (paragraph 11). \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" (paragraph 11). \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" (paragraph 11). This means that no matter what was near the Face on Mars during the photo, people would have been able to see what it was.\\n\\nFinally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth. \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West,\" (paragraph 12). The Face on Mars is quite similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho (paragraph 12). The fact the Face on Mars is resemblant to natural landforms on Earth makes it more understandable that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. This is because this lets people know that these types of natural landforms are possible, and that they are even common.\\n\\nConspiracy theorists may say that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars , and that NASA would rather hide this evidence (paragraph 5). However, in the 2001 photo of the Face there was no other evidence of life on Mars (paragraph 11). Also, the Face is considered a mesa which are very common on Mars (paragraph 3).Therefore these peoples\\' theories are not true.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Face on Mars is definitely a natural landform. This is because it is considered a Martian mesa which are common around Cydonia (2). Also, the Face on Mars can be justified as a natural landform because if their was any Martian life located near the Face on Mars during the 2001 NASA photo, people would have been able to see it and tell what it was.

In Vauban,Germany they have created a community where street parking, driveways, and home garages are geberally forbidden. 5,500 residents live within a a rectangular sqaure mile, making it more compact and more accessible for public transportantion. This makes stores a walk away, there is a main street, rather than a distant high way. Vauban, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, United States, and elsewhere. They are separting suburban life from auto use, a start of a movenment called \"smart planning.\"\\n\\nBogota, Colombia is starting a program that is spreading to other countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus yesterday. This is the third year cars have been banned, using only buses and taxis, these are only trasportantion permitted for the Day Without Cars. In this captial city, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The turnout was large even with the rain showers, \"The rain hasn\\'t stopped people from participating..,\" said Bogoto Mayor Antanas. And for the first time two other cities are joining the event. The day without cars is part of\\xa0 improvement campaign, they have constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most in Latin America.\\n\\nIn Paris they have started to enforce partial driving ban to clear the air of smog. On Mondays motorists\\xa0 with even numbered license plates to leave their cares at home, and on Tuesdays odd numbered licenses plates must do so as well. If they use their car they will get fined, 4,00 people were fined that Monday! This new plan of action is due to the intensifying smog in Paris, that monday 60% of the smog was down. In the Untied States less people are starting to use cars, not because they will be fined but because a change in culture. Many sociologist believe that a decrease in car usage will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and enviroment.\\n\\nTo conclude limiting car usuage seems to be a trend around the whole world. The advangtages of less car usuage, is they are building communties where cars arent nessacery, making programs to show there are other ways of trasportant, and less cars means less smog. The whole world is starting this new trend of less cars, you never know cars might not be a thing 50 years!

      "{'inputs.question': 'Dear Mrs. Senator,\\n\\nThe Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and a poorly representative system for our nation. Previous elections and facts show that the Electoral College may have worked in the past, but does not work in accuratley representing the millions of voters in our country any longer.\\n\\nIn the 2000 presidential campaign, the unfairness of the Electoral College was blatantly obvious. \"Seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all, and voters in twenty five of the largest media markets didn\\'t get to see a single campaig ad,\" (Plumer). The vote was left almost entirely in the hands of a few \"swing voters\" in Ohio, which is not an accurate representation of the opinions of the American population. During this campaign in 2000, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, however, Bush received 271 electoral votes to Gore\\'s 266,\\xa0 so Bush was elected president (Plumer). It is obvious that the votes of the Electoral College do not accurately reflect the opinions of the people, and gives the citizens of our country poor representation in our government.\\n\\nThe arguments in favor of the Electoral College are weak at best. In the article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner, the opening paragraph is practically an argument against the Electoral College. In the article, Posner states, \"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president... [t]he advocates of the position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic... it is the electors that choose the president, not the people.\" In this opening statement for an article about how great the Electoral College is, Posner proves quite the opposite. The people of our country deserve proper representation; each of their individual votes should be important and their opinions on who leads this country should be heard.\\n\\nAs stated in this counterclaim, it is not the people who choose the president- it is the electors in the unjust Electoral College system.\\n\\nAccording to a Gallup poll taken in 2000, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now (Plumer). It is clear the majority of the U.S.A. would prefer a different way of electing a president, whether that be a direct election, or another system that properly represents the nation\\'s opinions. The list of possibilities of things going wrong in the Electortal College is large. Suppose there was a tie, which is entirely possible, since there is an even number, 538, of Electoral votes (Posner). If this happened, the election of the president would be put in the hands of the House of Representatives. In this system, each state casts only one vote, so the representative from Wyoming who is casting a vote for 500,000 voters would have as much say as the representative from California, whose single vote represents the opinion of 35 million voters . If this isn\\'t an unethical process, I don\\'t know what is.\\n\\nMrs. Senator, as a citizen of the United States, and Democrat in the mainly Republican state of Florida, I want my voice to be heard.\\n\\nWith the current Electoral Collge system, I am worried that it won\\'t be. I shouldn\\'t have to worry about \"faithless\" electors refusing to vote for my party\\'s candidate, or the electors in my state not casting a vote that represents my opinions. In the free country of America, I want my vote to count and our government to make decisions based on what\\n\\nI say, not some electors from my state.

Venus is the second plantes from the sun it's too close to the sun for us to even try to make it there. Also no one knows how long it will take us to get to Venus wonder if the spacecraft run's out of oxygen. If it run's out of oxygen everyone will die before theyy make it to Venus, but wonder if they do make it to Venus it might not be a lot of oxygen to breathe in because the planet is so hot. Then wonder if there no water you need water to survive ecause Earth is a liquid based planet,but Venus is not.\\n\\nSecondly, how do we no if the spacecraft will be able to take that type of heat. The palnet surface temperatures on Venus average over 800 degrees fahrenheit I know that's way too hot. That type of temperature is beyond of what I can imagine I know Earth's surface is hot, but not that hot. Venus atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide I think it's like that, because it's so close the sun. The closer you get to the sun the more radiant energy it gives off and too much radiant energy can be bad.

I don't see how it can be our twin planet because it so hot and it's very radiant. The planet Venus has a rocky sediment and icludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Earth and Venus can be twins because Earth is not rocky it's a liquid based planet. Venus has a thin atmosphere because the heat keeps it's so hot and thin it can't get a break to even expand. But Earthis not as close, so Earth's atmosphere is a little bit thicker the Venus's atmosphere. Venus might also have some harmful chemicals.

He tells us how there have been multiple spacecraft sent to Venus but none have survived for a long period of time. For example, in the text the author states, \" No spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours.

He says that Venus is a worthy pursuit, but how is he supposed to convince readers this when at the same time he is saying that no spacecraft has been sent to Venus for more than thirty years.\\n\\nThe author also contradicts his idea of the value of exploring Venus by describing the planet. In paragraph three the author says that Venus has ninety-seven percent caron dioxide and has clouds that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid. He also states that Venus has the hottest surface temperature in our solar system and would liquefy many metals. These details do not help his idea at all.

Computers can short or glitsh on occasion every device glitshes.\\n\\nWhen childeren are young they don't think about the danger of being around a moving vechical. A driveless car would be running off of sensors and cameras. There could very well be a toddler running out in the middle of the road and the camera doesn't catch it and the sensors glitch the only outcome is either a dead child or a severly injured child. Teenagers will be in cars drinking and think they won't have to worry about driving then there breaks lock up on a patch of gravel that they didn't know was there next thing you know teeengers get killed in a car accident.

Also this technology can help teachers understand their students more.\\n\\nThis technology can help students if they are lost by reading their facial expression\\n\\nwhich then modifies the lesson as a human instructor. in the passage is says \" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is bored or lost, Then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor.\" This quote explains how the computer can help you in class by the way you feel or when you don\\'t understand the lesson in class.\\n\\nAnother way this new technology could be great in classes is that it can understand non verbal communication including emotional. like in the passage it says \" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.\" this quote states that this new technology can understand you in many ways, not just in facial expressions but also through both nonverbal and verbal communication.\\n\\nThese are my reasons why I agree in using this new technology in classes.

      "{'inputs.question': \"This new technology is actually valuable. In the story they talk about how making yourself smile still can make you happy. This technology could really help because then they can tell if someone is really unhappy. Most people do not want other people to know what they are feeling but it helps people around you. This technology can tell you like what percent happy you are or digusted or fearful or angry. Like Mona Lisa's percentages were 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 2 percent angry. With people being able to know how people in paintings were feeling you can put together what might be happening or what they are trying to point out.\\n\\nThis technology is actually very helpful because they can tell everything by just using a computer and using it on a painting to see what their emotions are. The computers can detect all 44 muscles in someone face. All the muscles have to move like human muscles. They say in the article that the movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. The Eckman has classified six basic emotions and those emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. An example they used by telling any of those is your frontalis pars laterials muscle which is above you eyes raises you eyebrows when you are surprised. A way they can tell that you are angery is when your orbicularis oris which are around your mouth tightens your lips.\\n\\nThere are many different things that this technology can tell about you which could really help because it could let people around you know how you are feeling instead of having to answer and you just say your fine. Like you can kind of tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. Everyone can have trouble describing like the reasons why they feel like that but atleast you can tell how they are feeling. Even if you do not know why they are feeling that way you can try and change how they are feeling. Like most people do not want to have to explain why they feel that way they just want a friend to be there for them and help you boost your mood. Computers are unstanding what peoples emotions are but they are still trying to figure out how to nonverbal communicate with someone.\\n\\nThe article gives you instructions to do while looking in the mirror. The first instruction is to raise your lips at the corners of your mouth, the next one is to then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes, the last one is holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes. They ask if you express in the mirror suggest an emotion and it does it is a happy emotion. Experts can even tell by just looking at a celebrity and they can tell if the are being truthful about being happy or if the are sad.\\n\\nThis technology could help many people. Do you just sit there sometimes and think what are they feeling or are they sad or happy well now you can tell by just doing some very easy things. Like you can use a computer that can recognize what you are feeling even if you are just sitting there doing something the computer can still tell. You can even learn ways to just look at someones face and can tell how they are feeling by just the muscles on their face. This can help friends they will be able to tell how their best friend is feeling and they can try and change their mood. Even if it does not seem helpful it really is, by just telling what someones emotions is by just looking at them can actually change a lot of things.\", 'score': '3', 'gpt_coherence_x': '3.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '2456', 'gpt_coherence_y': '5.0', 'gpt_relevance': '5.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",
      "{'inputs.question': 'Do you ever feel like you should join a Seagoing Cowboys program? You should join the program because it helps the world, saves people and animals, and it good if you do join. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program and that you are helping many peoples lives and saving people to not run away and fight back.\\n\\nFirst, it helps the world by in 1945 World War II, was being taken over by Europe and Europe made so many countries leave the ruins and it was just not right for people to move out of their countries. So 44 nations formed a group called the,\" UNRRA which meant (the United Nations Relief and Rehailitation Adminstration.) So I think it would help if more people joined and you could beat the Europe people who wanted to fight.\\n\\nThen, save the people and animals by UNRRA had hired the \"Seagoing Cowboys\" to take care of the young cows, horses, and mules that had been shiped overseas. That is when Luke and Don had signed up. So after they had signed up in August 1945, they had got a orders to report to New Orleans. When Luke and Don arrived on August 14 Luke had said,\" The day the Pacific war ended.\" Everyone got their seaman\\'s papers and boarded that had SS Charles W. Wooster, headed to Greece with a cargo of horses and enough hay to eat So I think that if more people sign up more animals and people will be saved.\\n\\nLast, good for you to join Seagoing Cowboys program its good by saving peoples lives and animals lives and by keeping the countries save so people can be happy if you join. And that if you join you can be rewarded will a big surprise in the end of the war that is going on. So now I think that you should always think before youself and join.\\n\\nIn conclusion, you should always join to be happy for what you did and joining would help the Seagoing Cowboys program.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Driverless Cars Are Coming\\n\\nAs everything in our society based on science and technology, cars are also developing from human control to driverless. The article on the left introduces how big companies (for instance, Google, BMW, etc.) are trying to make driverless cars come into our daily life and how the law will change if we have driverless cars commonly. Once driverless cars come into our life, people will argue that is it good to develop driverless cars or is it bad?\\n\\nIn my opinion, I have a positive aspects of driverless cars. The first and the most direct reason is because driverless cars can make our daily life much more convenient than before. We don\\'t need to worry about which road are we driving on or any places we haven\\'t been before. The car will drive for us, it will have plan for which road or direction we\\'ll be.\\n\\nThe second reason is the driverless cars are safer than people driving by themselves. Sometimes people cannot drive safely when they are tired or get drunk. That can make a huge accident. But the driverless cars can help us to drive, \"The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone\". (passage 5) By using the sensor in the car, we don\\'t need to worry about safety anymore. The sensor can control the car and give us a much safer trip than ever before.\\n\\nThe third reason is driverless cars can reduce the quantity of accidents. When people are using the driverless cars, they \"must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver\\'s attention whenever a probelm occurs\". (passage 7) Although it is driverless car, drivers still need to pay attention.\\n\\nConvenience, safety, reduction of accidents... These are the reasons we choose to use the driverless cars. There is a huge number of people who still have negative aspects of the driverless cars. Technologies need to impprove, we can improve our phones, our computers, but why not cars? The driverless cars the symbol of the improvement to technologies and driverless cars can bring us a lot of benefits.

If a student is sad but doesn't want everyone to know becase they dont want to talk about it then Facs would not give that student the space they need.\\n\\nFACS is reading your emotions before you know what your emotions are.

      "{'inputs.question': 'As the global concern for the environment increases with time, the desire to use cars decreases. People are aware that cars release fumes which, when combined, can be detrimental for the environment, and they want to do something about it. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes in her New York Times article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\", that up to fifty percent of environmental greenhouse gas pollution comes from the cars driven in American suburbs. In her article, she quotes David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, that \"All of our [the U.S.A.\\'s] development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\". It seems like America, and the rest of the world, is becoming more aware about what cars can do to the environment and that car usage needs to decrease, and they are taking steps to do so. So why should you limit your car usage? By limiting car usage, the average citizen can decrease pollution and harmful greenhouse gases that are causing damage to the environment, improve living conditions in large cities and reduce smog, and feel better in general, with more exercise and less stress.\\n\\nIn the past decade, America has struggled with an obesity epidemic. In the early 2000s, obesity was at its peak, with McDonalds\\' \"Super Size\" menu options, huge SUVs, and endless television programs to keep couch potatos on the couch. If you visit New York City\\'s Manhattan, you won\\'t see a whole lot of obese people hurrying down 5th avenue to hop on the subway or pick up groceries at the local market. Why is this? Not many people drive in NYC, mainly because it would be far too expesive to buy and park a car in this already monumentally expensive city. The cars one does generally see are either from out of state, taxis, or businessmen who live in the other boroughs of the city. Very few who live in Manhattan drive. Most people take the subway, walk, or use bikes to get around. Because of the way it\\'s made, everything one needs is just a few blocks away, from the grocery store, to the drugstore, to the postoffice, to the bank, there really is no need to have a car. If you have to go to the airport, just take a cab. Naturally, people who walk and bike everywhere are slimmer and healthier. In the suburbs, this is not the story. Many people in the suburbs drive cars out necessity, because it would take the whole day to walk to the grocery store and back. The way suburbs are set up, walking or biking is almost impossible to do if it\\'s not for leisure. Driving around all day to pick up kids, go to work, and finally pull into the home garage can be draining and stressful. If people were to get around and get exercise at the same time, they would be less stressed and healthier. Andrew Selsky quoted businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in his article, \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\". Plaza said that, \"It\\'s [limiting car usage] a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\". Many people are already doing this. Vauban, Germany, is a new \"car-free\" suburb. In this town, things are close together, just like a city, eliminating the need to use cars. It is not illegal to own a car in Vauban, but people who do must pay a heavy fine and pay for parking on the edge of the city that is also highly expensive. People in the German suburb get along fine without cars, because of the way the city was built. The idea of a \"car-reduced\" community appeals to the U.S. as well, and legislators and other government officials are trying to make it happen for the environment as well as the sake of the people.\\n\\nBejjing is supposedly the most polluted city in the world, and Paris the most beautiful, but Paris is more polluted than one would think. Robert Duffer reports in his article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", that Paris, after suffering from \"five days of intensive smog\" called for some drivers to abstain from using their cars for the day or face a fine of twenty-two euros. The system was based on license plate numbers. One day, the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be able to drive, the next the ones with odd numbered license plates. This helped reduce smog in the city, which is more polluted than others in Europe like Brussels and London. Once the smog cleared, the ban was rescinded. This ban on cars, although only for a short period of time, is actually a great idea. Emissions from cars cause a large amount of smog to pollute the air, which is bad for both the inhabitants of the city and the environment. The reduction of the use of cars will reduce the amount of smog in the air in large cities, and improve the living conditions in those cities. Almost two centuries ago, smog, soot, and dirt covered Victorian London and its people. This smog was not from cars, but rather from the rising popularity of factories powered by fossil fuels such as coal. Today, all cities of the world are polluted, and almost two hundred years have passed. Shouldn\\'t some improvements regarding the environment and smog in cities have been made by now? There is just as much environmental damage being done as there was in 19th century London, but now, instead of factories being the main cause, it\\'s cars. Although cities are cleaner now, they are just as polluted. In Bejjing, some say the air is so dirty that if you blow your nose, your tissue turns black! It is the 21st century, and we have to be taking strides to improve the environment for the good of the people who live in cities like Paris and Bejjing.\\n\\nLimiting car usage is important to create a better living environment for people as well as improve their well-being, but the most important reason is to limit pollution and damage to the environment due to emmisions from cars. President Obama, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, \"The End of Car Culture\", has \"ambitious goals to curb the Unites States\\' greenhouse gas emissions\". If the President of the United States is concerned, this means it is a real problem. The immense amount of greenhouse gases caused by cars has already aided Global Warming and the damage to the ozone layer that exists today. If car usage increases or holds steady, even more damage will be done, so much so that it may become unfixable in the future. If the world does not cut back now on its vehicle usage and reduce environmental damage, things will only get harder to fix. But things are looking good for Mother Nature, because according to all four articles given, including, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", by Robert Duffer, \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", by Andrew Selsky, and \"The End of Car Culture\", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, people are already taking steps to reduce the use of cars and better the environment.\\n\\nEver since the Model T came out in the early 20th century, cars have become more and more popular in America as well as around the world. They have become so popular, in fact, that they have become a problem. Cars emit harmful greenhouse gases that pollute the environment and cause excess smog in large cities. They can also be stressful and unhealthy for people who depend on them for everyday modes of transport. Limiting car usage is important and will help not only the environment, but also the people of the world.       \\xa0    ', 'score': '5', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '2803', 'gpt_coherence_y': '5.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",
      "{'inputs.question': 'Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save moeny. Also due to many different reasons, even if it\\'s for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it\\'s China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minizie pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren\\'t the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are.\\n\\nIn Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. \"Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park\" (Rosenthal 2) but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. \"Car-owners can buy a space, for $40,000, along with a home.\" (Rosenthal 2) That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article \"\\n\\nIn German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\\n\\n\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of Vauban\\'s Families don\\'t even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn\\'t that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don\\'t have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely.\\n\\nDue to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a \"partial driving ban to clear the air or global city\" (Duffer 10). For example, in this article called \"\\n\\nParis bans driving due to smog\\n\\n\" by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be $31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn\\'t produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn\\'t have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn\\'t really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about \"4,000 drivers were fined,\" and \"27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine\" (Duffer 12). Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that \"Congestion was down 60 percent\" (Duffer 14). The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough.\\n\\nBogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. \"\\n\\nCar-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\\n\\n\" by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia.\\n\\nFor a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of \"7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.\" (Selsky 21) Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has \"118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City.\" (Selsky 27) One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries.\\n\\nYet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called \"\\n\\nThe End of Car Culture\\n\\n\", is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. \"Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" (Rosenthal 29) The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, \"Obama\\'s ambitious goals to curb the United States\\' greenhouse gas emissions\" (Rosenthal 29). New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It\\'s already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn\\'t there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be.\\n\\nTo wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air (unless it\\'s a hybrid). The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages.       \\xa0    ', 'score': '4', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '2811', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

The author states, \"Venus, sometimes called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.\" So from afar we can see it as a big \"light\" in the sky, kind of like a star. But Venus is not a star it is a planet. What he means by this is that you can see how bright Venus is from afar but what you can\\'t see what it is really like close up. But if we dont know what Venus is like close up then how do we know it is Earth\\'s \"twin\"?\\n\\nVenus is often referred to as Earth\\'s \"twin\". According to the text \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the clostest distance too.\" The passage also states, \"Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.\" So if Venus is so much like earth then why can\\'t we send a spacecraft to Venus now? Well we tried and it didnt workout. There was a spacecraft sent unmanned because the spacecraft could only survive the landing for three hours. Venus today still have some features that are close to ours on earth. Could this mean it could become safe sometime? Doubtful. According to the passage, \"Venus is a planet that has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters.\" So why do we need to get so up close to Venus even though it causes risks?\\n\\nWouldn\\'t you like to know whats on Venus even if it could be dangerous? I beileve this is why the author suggest thst Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it precents. You may wonder what thoes dangers are. According to the passage, \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus\\'s atmosphere. On the planet\\'s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" So why should we still go? NASA is finding a possible solution to the hostile conditions. According to the text \"NASA\\'s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hoveriing 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground confitions by staying up and out of their way.\" It also states, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" This means we would be able to see and get more information about Venus.\\n\\nI conclude that because of all the new findings that this is why the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit dispite the dangers. If Venus is like Earth does that mean that what happened to Venus might happen to us? This is why we need more information. The author shows us how we can see Venus from afar but we don\\'t know what it is like close up, its often reffered to as earths twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks.

Driverless cars are not completely driverless though because they alert the driver when they are needed to take over.

Therefore, it allows for a better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\\n\\nEven though driverless cars can do some things on their own, the human driver must still remain alert and be ready to take over when necessary. For this reason, it is necessary for the car to be ready to notify the driver when a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, and the Google car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. These are both ways that can alert a driver when it is time for them to drive, which can help people to be ready to focus while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driverless cars can be beneficial to us and help drivers while they are driving. The drivers of these cars must also be alert as well too. There are sensors and other developments that can help with this process and notify drivers when it is time for them to take control. Everything will not happen right away because it is a process that will take time to be sought through and manufactured correctly.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Everyone assumes that the best way of transportation is by a car. Teenagers dream of getting their license on their sixteenth birthday and maybe even getting a car. Most adults use cars to get to and from work, drive their kids around and do fun activites. But what people don\\'t understand is that there are so many other alternatives that ultimately result in a happier and healthier planet. There are so many downfalls with driving and owning a car that many are now believeing that it is much more reasonable to just not own a car.\\n\\n\"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" (Rosenthal, line 6). Having cars stress people out and people don\\'t even realize this. There are so many responsiblities that come with driving. No one enjoys sitting in long traffic jams. It is annoying and quite bothersome. Everyone gets so frustrated, nevermind the amounts of accidents that lead to injury and death from it all.\\n\\nIn Colombia there is a day once a year in which cars can not go on the road or they are served with a fine. This effort is to try to bring stress levels down and stop air pollution. \"Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily and devoid of traffic jams\" (Selsky, line 23). This idea promoted excersize and got people out and doing things in the community. The citizens clearly were not against this day or else they wouldn\\'t have been acticve. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\" (Selsky, line 28). This just goes to show what driving does. It isolates people. Without all the cars, one is more willing to spend time outside and interacting with other people and since people were out and about more and enjoying the community, the area has gotten more presentable and pleasureable to be in. \"...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" (Selsky, line 29). Officals and shop owners are making more of an effort because everyone is more active and caring.\\n\\nIn Paris, the officals made an effort to try and clean up the cities pollution rates. They assigned a day where even number licensed plates could not be on the road and a day for odd numbered plate cannot be on the road or else they will be fined. \"Congestion was down 60 percent\" (Duffer, 14). If anything, it goes to show that the amount of cars on the road is absurb. 60 percent is more than half, that\\'s a lot of traffic. Paris primarily uses diesel, causeing a lot more pollution in this busy city. \"Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals\" (Duffer, line 17). Paris is a very touristy area and people go in hopes to see a beautiful city. This project went so well that officals planned to continue it. \"The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.\" (Duffer, line 19). If officals planned to continue this idea, than it must be benifical in some way. If citizens just made an effort to not drive everywhere, than restrictions would not have to be mad. It\\'s because of the amount of driving that is going on that officals have to get involved.\\n\\n\"...transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions...\" (Rosenthal, line 37) Motor vehicals cause so much danger to Earth. The amount of pollution is so high and dengerous. It is much easier to prevent than everyone believes. One could simply take the bus, ride a bike, only drive to work and needed places, walk, and even car pool. There are an abundant amount of ways to prevent so much pollution and stress. It\\'s all over the world that this is an issue; Paris, Colombia, the United States, and many other places. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. \" (Rosenthal, line 11). That is a lot. It isn\\'t difficult to help prevent this.\\n\\nIn the long run, not driving would result in happier people anyways. Cars are so expensive that is would cause less aggravation and economic stress as well as the basic stress of just driving and being in traffic. Society could make the world so much cleaner and safer for the next generations. It starts now. Get a bike or a pair of walking shoes and start getting active in the community. Start making the changes now so it isn\\'t forced by officals later. make the effort and show the next generations how life should be. This could lead to a much happier and healthier life style.

Minimizing car usage gives you the opportunity to have more parks and fun places to go without the parking lot taking up all the space.\\n\\nLess space for parking makes everything more easier to get to which is an advantage instead of having to walk in the parking lot . For example, \" . . . make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking.\" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ). This explains that if you get rid of the cars theres more space to park and everything else becomes easier to get to versus having many parking spaces taking up room and causing traffic and other things. Also with not using cars theres more room for small stores and big stores to be put in different places that couldnt be put there because of cars so you could drive. For example, \" . . . stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ) and \" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour retsrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky, Paragraph 28). This shows that now there\\'s more spaces for even more stores which is an advantage because the cars used to take up that space used for bigger roads for more cars to come on but without that problem theres room for other thing\\'s.\\n\\nAlso it\\'s a good way to save money because it decreases smog, and air polllution. For example, \" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog.\" ( Paris bans driving due to smog, Robert Duffer, Paragraph 14).\\xa0 This shows that after France decided to stop using cars the smog decreased tremendisely.

Because of this, some cities like Vauban, Germany are making their communties car free. Doing this can cut down on the amount of gas that comes from the tail pipes of cars, making the enviroment healthier and making it easier to breathe. Not as many cities are going as extreme as Vauban, but they taking the extra measures. In Paris, France the amount of pollution to due to car usage was getting higher by day. So they enforced a partial drivng ban, if they didnt follow this law they would have to pay the thirty one dollar fine. In Bogota, Colombia, they have a car free day that is now spreading to the borders, such as Paraguay. Even by cutting down a few times a day will not only help the enviroment, but will also help people breathe easier too.\\n\\nHaving a car can put a lot of stress on someones shoulders.

I have a concern about whether they tested this on other things but of coarse they did but I'd like to see the process of how this works because the Mona Lisa is a nonmoving painting while people are constantly feeling an aray of emotions.\\n\\nI believe this technology would not be useful to read students emotions because student emotions can change from sitting in a classroom to taliking to a friend during a lesson. I believe that the machine would not be able to calculate the exact emotion a student is feeling quick enough because we can have multiple layers of emotions at the same time for instence fear, anxiety, and confliction. Also the machine would have to monitor multiple faces at onces since this is a classroom and find the emotions of the majority and gear the lesson towards that.

To some they are looked at as a need such as water, food, or shelter rather something we want to improve our life. Although, it may improve our lives in the particular moment to some degree, we fail to see the greater and more long-term effects from everyday car usage. The following sources reviews these effects and reveals the problems and solutions we may have to fix them.\\n\\nOne of the more serious and more recognized problems from car usage is the steady increase of greenhouse gas emissions produced from vehicles all over the world. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Vauban, Germany is an example of the effort being made to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions, this experimental city is trying to remain \"car-free\" and in doing so the city itself has to make its own changes. This basic precept is being adopted around the world by trying to compact suburbs and make them more accessible by public transportation.\"When i had a car i was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" said by heidrun walter(source 1). With this new experiment, people are finding ways to adapt and live the changed life while others actually feel better off.\\n\\nAnother serious and impacting issue from car usage is the increase in smog over big named cities. In paris, after days of a near record breaking pollution, paris bans driving throughout the city in attempt to clear up the skies. Diesel fuel is looked at as main problem paris faced in cleaning out the intesifying smog, since a france tax act favors diesel over gasoline it displays an issue the france government must correct in their own wrong doings. A different look towards car usage is that recent studies show americans buying fewer cars, getting fewer and fewer licenses, and also driving less overall. If this pattern continues there will be positive reinforcements for carbon emissions and the environment, since its the 2nd largest emission producer in America. The internet brings a whole other chess piece to the game allowing kids to feel more connected with people without driving anywhere. \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" said by Bill Ford excutive chairman of the Ford Motor Company(source 4).\\n\\nA program set up in bogota, colombia is a program developed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. \"its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" said businessman carlos arturo(source 3).

Cars have played a major role in our societys till today, for family road trips, fild trips, sports events, and even going to school. Today many peoples ideals on cars are withering into a more fundumental and evnviromental mind set on why people should limit driving, and or if not, dish it out compleatly. showing the positive effects on why limiting car use is good and showing how bad it can turn if we dont limit the driving in our daily lives.\\n\\nWhy is it good to limit driving in our socities today a few reasons are that they reduce stress, it lessens air pollution, its a healthy life style, and it is much safer. In source 3\\n\\nCar-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky states \"\\n\\n\"\\n\\nIt\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\"\\n\\nsaid businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.\" this quote, quoted from selsky states that not only did car bring pollution but also stress because of bills and damages these cars brought to our socities, so because of limited driving and more open space to breath clean air most stress is readuced. Air pollution is a big factor that we face today in some countries like Pairs, Germany, Japan, China, and our own country The United States of America. The limitation of cars can reduce this problem and help us keep a cleaner society. Today countries like Germany, Pairs, and Colombia are taking large steps into saving our world from smog by creating comunities that dont allow cars in them ( source1\\n\\nIn German Suburb, Life Gose On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosethal\\n\\n), or bans drving because of smog ( source 2\\n\\nParis bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer)\\n\\n, and creates days that become popular that invoves a day or days without driving ( source 3\\xa0Car-free day in spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky). In source 4\\n\\nThe End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal shows us on how todays generation (21st century) is less intrested in cars than the people in the 20th century generations. This decrease of intest may be because of car accedents and or the reason that they feel no need to get a car. This is and can be possible in we limit the public and personal transportation.\\n\\nCars and any type of transportantion hase been a big benifactor to many people through the 20th and 21st Century but it has caused many dmages not only to the atmosphere, but to our comunities too. Cars have caused stress on people due to car bills, damage to there cars that might not have been there fault but the other civilians fault, it also creates stress by the living conditions for example ( our air due to pollution ). In source 2\\n\\nParis bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer he states \" After days of near- record pollution, Pairs enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\" he states that Pairs air pollution was so bad that they had to ban the city from drivning. Air pollution is not only bad in Paris, France but it is also bad in countries like Germany, Colombia, the US, and Beijing,China holding a record of the most polluted cities in the world. Because pollutuion is a very big problem in our socities today it can cause breathing problems and or mental disorders. Cars have also caused congestion preventing people to get to their destinations on time. this all could and is happening because of the no limitation of cars.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Cars have held a huge impact to our comunity that led to some benifit but mostly damage like pollution, stress, and congestion; on the other hand due to the limitation of cars not only do we have less air pollution but it also reduces stress and helps people live a more healthy life style.

      "{'inputs.question': \"Florida Senator:\\n\\nAfter reading a few articles explaining the Electoral College system and reading arguements for and against it, I have decided the system is not worth keeping in place. The system does not take every voter into account, and our electors are not always reliable. Also, this system of voting can discourage citizens in non-swing states from voting, which may be it's greatest crime. The Electoral College is worn out and ready for retirement.\\n\\nThe Electoral College, although seemingly based on the people's votes, is really dependent on whoever the chosen electors want as president. It does not seem very fair for voters to spend months listening to drawn out debates, campaign commercials, and becoming educated on the candidates, just to have their vote essentially thrown away if they did not vote for the majority. No, they do not even get to see their vote in action. It is simply erased and given to a slate of electors who stand for the majority of the state, even if the majority is only 50.1%. To the new generation of voters who really want to make a difference in the government, the idea that unless we pick the 'right' candidate for our state, our votes really do not matter is absurd.\\n\\nIn the electoral college system, even the majority voters in each state can not count on having reliable electors, according to Bradford Plumer, the author of an anti-Electoral College-article. Electors can be anyone who does not hold a public office, and these people can be swayed or unloyal to their own party as well (Plumer). These are the people our votes are really going towards, not the actual president as many uneducated could be led to believe. Although the trust of these people is rarely misplaced (Richard A. Posner, In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our present method of choosing the President), there is always a possibility of the electors being swayed at the last minute, which is a bit of a scary thought. Imagine if segregationists in the Loisiana legislature had succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, one of or best presidents (Plumer).\\n\\nThe final reason keeping the Electoral College system in place is a bad idea is that if you are a voter in a clearly defined state, that is, non-swing, you are more likley to decide not to vote at all. When candidates can clearly define states in which they know they will win, or have no hope of winning, they don't bother spending time there to educate voters. Voters in these states do not get all the information they might want in order to make an educated decision. This would lead to a biased, uneducated state in which voters don't care to vote because of a mindset that almost everyone in the state is of a certain political mindset and their vote is just another piece of paper that will not matter. These voters could also make rash decisions because they did not get to truly hear all of the campaignes. In swing states where there is not a clearly defined political opinion, voters will be bombarded with information, and although they may be educated and well versed in their opinions, the votes, no matter how close, will not really matter because of the nature of the Electoral College system.\\n\\nIn closing, the Electoral College system is not worth saving. Although some may argue it gives a certainity of outcome or restores the balance to heavily populated states (Posner), it does not give everyone's vote a fair chance. Nor does it guarantee the electors will be reliable. The Electoral College system even dissuades voters from excercising their Constitutional right to vote.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Human emotion, once about feelings and expression, can now be calculated and recognized by a computer, as if it were a math problem. As stated in the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D\\'Alto, there is a new technology created by Prof. Thomas Huang, as a way to improve the relationship between computers and humans. Meaning, ads and websites would be able to assess the user and adjust what is shown, depending on the emotions of the human. The example given in the article is\"... if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screan, a smiliar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different\" (D\\'Alto 6). Not only is this device useful in the world of marketing, but may also be of use in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would have great value in the way teachers and students communicate,as a way to improve the education of students and the way teachers teach. Though there are many pros and cons in this given situation, if done right, this device could help students greatly.\\n\\nTo begin, the use of FACS would be a wonderful way to help students and teachers communicate indirectly. This would be done through a computer that could analyze the movement of the muscles in the face to identify the six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, disgust, fear, and sadness. In a classroom setting, whether it be during an assignment or lecture, teachers would be able to use FACS to read the emotional response of the students to help determine their thoughts on the given subject. This could allow teachers to improve and change the way they do things, in order to better the students educational experience. In addition, this technology could be utilized to keep students honest in the classroom, expecially on assignments and tests. The complexity of FACS is able to read mixed emotions, which would allow teachers to build an understanding on their students, and help the teachers find a way to relate to the students. Also, a conselor may also be able to help students more effieciently with the use of this device. They would be able to read the emotions of students to help them determine the mental and emotional state of a students. Though all of these pros seem good on paper, there are also many cons that come with it.\\n\\nUltimately, it is quite clear that this device may seem intrusive to some people. As stated in the article, \"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements...\" (D\\'Alto 4), this technology would be able to use videos to track facial movements and determine how people feel. Some students may think that their rights are being violated with the use of FACS. Students may not want teachers to know how they feel, especially if the feeling is negative. However, D\\'Alto states, \"...we humans perform this same impressive \\'calculation\\' every day\" (D\\'Alto 5), meaning people naturally utilize the function of decoding emotion. It\\'s most likely not that difficult to determine how someone feels. In current technology, there are fingerprint scans and facial recognition, that essentially have the same purpose. So, in the end, this device may not be as intrusive as people may think.\\n\\nOverall, using the Facial Action Coding System would benefit many people within the school system. Teachers would be able to connect with students and determine whether their teaching methods are working or not. This would then improve the education that the students receive and result in a happier classroom environment and better grades. The FACS\\' understanding and analyzing of emotion may eventually lead to the improvement of education and the attitutes students have towards school.

Throughout the article, it shares ideas from NASA, which is the foundation that discovered the face on Mars in the first place.\\n\\nThe first statement that the article makes about the face being a natural landform is, \"New high-resolution images and 3D alimetry from NASA\\'s Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.\" This one statement shows that NASA, one of the biggest names in space industry, believes the face is only a mesa. The people back in the Jet Propulsion Lab must have been surprised to see such a startling sight, but luckily NASA provides more information to show that the face is only a simple landform.\\n\\nThe text provides a caption from the message unveiled by NASA. The caption states, \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" This exact caption says the exact proof that the face is clearly just a rock formation. Every person should already know how shadows can, well, cast shadows that may give illusions of other objects.\\n\\nSome people that believe in aliens may say that it would be crazy to think that a rock formation and shadows could form the illusion of a face, but I\\'ve seen shadows that are casted when the sun hits them just right. Isn\\'t it completely logical that the sun could hit the shadows to fill the holes in the rocks? I sure believe so.\\n\\nThe last quote I would like to give as my evidence is, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you couold see what they were!\" This single statement shows that the cameras they were using to the maximum resolution, would in fact show if there was actually an alien artifact on the planet. But the strongest possible photo showed no ancient alien artifacts. It only showed a natural rock formation with shadows that formed what appeared to be a face.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Is the use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System valuable to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom?. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D\\'alto, the author describes how a new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promissing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a sudent is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it hepls the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them.\\n\\nSchool brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the techers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or thewy might be confused but afraid to speak up so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". It also states \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor\". By this evidence , the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored; this would allow them to think throught about changing a new method to teach so the studetns don\\'t get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The mayority of students nowdays don\\'t care about school or just don\\'t get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don\\'t bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success but they don\\'t implement it, so what is best than a new tehnology to help out a little.\\n\\nThere are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time.. Wouldn\\'t it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles\". It also states \"The software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Da Vinci\\'s masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)\". This evidence illustrates by the aouthor shows how great and advanced this technology is, being able to identify not only one emotion, but more than one at the same time, letting the world know, but most important the teachers in a classroom that they don\\'t have to worry more about to be able to identify by guessing how a student is doing, because this technology has the answers. It is so hard to identify when a person is feeling all types of feelings and not be able to help out becuase no one knows what the mixed feelings are . Teachers have a rough time with students trying to figure it out. But with ths technology teahcers would be more notified of the problem, so they create a scenari to help them out.\\n\\nEmotions are everywhere, everyone experience at least one of them. This new technology not only helps the person to express an emotion but to produce them. A teacher in a classroom is able to teach but sometimes they are not able to transmit the feeling of learing to the students, and the new technology Facial Action Coding System would be a lot of help. In the passage it states \"The Mona Lisa is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do\". It also states \"Most human communication is nonverbal, incluiding emotional communication\". By this evidence the author projects how this new technology is capable of doing just anything and how it helos to improve the best on a classroom, helping out not only the students but the teachers. With this new technology teachers would be able to get the students to be more interested in the class, leading them to get a good grade, and to the understanding of every new topic.\\n\\nNow, Do you think this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?. By being able to detect 6 basic emotions and even mixed emotions, to recognize whether a student is bored or confused and by helping the person not only to express the emotion but to produce it, it is shown that this new technology is valuable. Communication is one of the basic steps to create a better living world but sometimes communication is just not implemented in society. So the help of this new technology is needed. A teacher woulld be able to help a student is they knew if the students where confused or bored. They would try different types of ways to get back the attention of the students so they can do good in the calls. Another reason is being able not only to know one emotion but multiple emotions; Teachers wouldn\\'t have to be guessing the emotions of the studetns, and the time lose trying to guess their emotions, they would be finding ways to help the student solve their problem, becuase they already know what is going on. In the classroooms it is very hard for the sdtudents to concentrate in a very boring topic, and the teachers just will continue beuase the sdtudents just don\\'t communicate or show anything else than just a black emotion and this new technology is able to get the person to express the emotion. Is really interesting what this technology can do.

      "{'inputs.question': \"How would exploring venus be dangerous? Well first of all in the text is states that the planets surface is an average of over 800 degrees fahrenheit. Thats pretty hot compared to the temperatures that we get here in the US. Some countries may be hotter than others but no one is near 800 degrees. That would be a very dangerous trip for any one knowing how hot it is there. It also states that the atmospheric acid pressure ios 90 times greater that what we experience on pur own planet. It also states that this type of environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Yes I agree that many people would want to see up close what things are on Venus but now in time there is no way that we could get a human up there and get samples of things mainly becuase of the pressure and the temperature.\\n\\nStudying Venus is a definant worth pursuit but like i said earlier the teperature and the pressure is to hard for any human to get up there. Getting even a rock from Venus would help us learn things about the planet that we may not even know about today. They said in the passage that they have gotten robots out to venus but that is still hard to tell anything because Venus is a very cloudy planet, but even with a robot it is still hard to tell anything because of the fact that robots are good but they can't always work the way that you want them to work. In the passage it asks why scientists are discussing further visits to its surface? thats a good question that I would even ask them. The answer to that question is that astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Eart-like planet in ur solar system. It says that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. From what people and scientists have said today about Venus it doesn't sound like it has that anymore. If it is 800 degrees on that planet all the oceans are gone and I don't think that they will return because of that. If your planet is 800 degrees all your oceans are dried up and any type of water is dried up as well.\\n\\nI agree with the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. If you go to Venus you will most likely die but if you don't go how are we going to study anything from that planet, and how are we going to learn anything about the planet itself. It says in the passage striving to meet the challenges presented by venus has values, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but shold be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. In the is paragraph is is saying that even though venus would be very hard to research that we should saty with venus and one day be able to go their and study. even if it is dangerous, some sientists want to go their even for the danger that it may constist of. Going to Venus would be awesome but at the same time I don't know if going their for the risks that it has would be the smartest thing to do. You could go their and 5 minutes leater be dead. I wouldn't want to do that because I would want to live. Some people are different than me because they like adventure and getting out of their comfort zone but for me that wouldn't be the case.\\n\\nGoing to venus would be a huge sucess but the risks that it has I don't know if going their is worth it. Being able to study everything that it has on the planet would be huge. Learing about the things that go on there would also be huge to know. In the end If you as an individual would like to go the Venus and study the planet and the things that go on their you should go for it even at the dangers that it holds. If you are the type of person that enjoys adventure and learning about new things, I would say that this is the type of adventure that you would want to go on. I say this because of the simple reason that Venus has never been searched in depth, I mean in paragraphy two it states that spacecrafts that have landed their have only been able to survive for a few hours. obviously you could explore a little bit with this amount of time but with an entire planet it would be hard to only have a few hours to explore. you could definantly get a decent way with a few hours but because its an entire planet it would be very hard to discover new things because the craft can't go very fast and the craft can't move as fast as a human would be able to with a few hours. would you rather have multiple humans go out their and research or would you rather have one spacecraft go and research only one way for a few hours. Even if the humans know that they most likely would survive for very long. they could grab somethings that they could put into the shuttle and then the shuttle would return home and the scientists would be able to study later wen the shuttle returns home with all the possible things that the astronauts found on Venus. If Humans went out on a mission to study it states that 97 perscent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmostphere. (Paragraphy3) You know how hard it would be for someone to survive in that type of weather. If you send a astronaut to go and research you are basically asking one of you men to go up there and risk his life to study what is up there.\\n\\nIn the passage it says that Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin But I disagree with that statement. Venus is way more toxic and way for dangerous for humans to go up and study. For one thing the temperature is way to high and the amount of chemicals that could possibly kill you are things that are way to dangerous for any human to go and study. If you send a man up there you are asking him to die to research things that could be useful. if you step onto venus's land you are most likely going to die because of the difference on everything from what your used to. even is suits you are most likely going to die because of the differences. I know I wouldn't want to die.\", 'score': '3', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '2.0', 'Line number': '4262', 'gpt_coherence_y': '2.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",
      "{'inputs.question': 'I think that driverless cars could be a good thing or a bad thing, but I think that the pros out weigh the cons. First of all the numbers of deaths and car accidents would be derastically decreased. If all the cars were automated you would have no human emotions getting in the way of driving and there would be very few mistakes made on the road.\\n\\nDriverless cars are becoming safer and safer over the years. The article states that Google has had cars that could drive independendtly under specific conditions since 2009. It is now seven years since that point and the reliability and the safety of driverless cars has gone up. If we have driverless cars the roads would be much safer. There are some people that are driving to and from work very early or very late at night. Withought a doubt these people are suffering from sleep deprivation. These people have a higher chance of having a car accident then the rest of the poppulation. If cars were driverless then these people would not have to worry about driving. In later years, as technology advances, they might have the oppurtunity to relax and maybe sleep on the car ride home or to work.\\n\\nBecause of these arguments I think that driverless cars are a very real possibility. I think that people underestimate the power of the computer and what it can do. I would have more trust in a highly inteligent computer to drive me somewhere then a taxi driver. As long as technology continues to progress and evolve I think that within a few years there will be a few driverless cars in the mix with our normal traffic.', 'score': '3', 'gpt_coherence_x': '3.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '4271', 'gpt_coherence_y': '4.0', 'gpt_relevance': '5.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",

This tehcnology could be of value for students. The Facial Action Coding System can be beneficially useful to read the emtions of students in a classroom to provide insight on how students feel about specific classes and how they react to challenging subjects, and to change the way classes are taught.\\n\\nAccording to the author, in paragraph four, the Facial Action Coding System can identify various emotions. The software can even identify mixed emotions when people have an expressionless or neutral face. The FACS software has the proper anatomical information for the human body. It can easily identify what a person is feeling even if they have several emotions present at once. In paragraph six Dr. Huang states that a classroom computer with the FACS software could recognize what a student is feeling, whether they are bored or confused. If a computer can identifythe emotions of students in a classroom, then this can be used to make modifications to the lesson or maybe the whole class. For example, if a student is struggling in a certain subject and the computer were to identify the whole classroom as confused or bored then the teacher would have to make improvements to the lesson. This would benefit the students who are feeling lost or bored.\\n\\nIf the FACS software could identify the emotions of the student, then this can be used to find improvements for certain classes that students struggle in. In paragraph six, Dr. Huang says that most human communication can be nonverbal. If a student was in a difficult class and was to embarrassed to ask for help, the FACS software has the capacity to identify the precise muscle moevment for the expression of cofusion in that student. Paragraphs seven and eight of the passage describe the small muscle movements made to convey a true smile. The author then goes on to say that these muscles can be spotted to prove whether or not someone is displaying a sincere emotion. Paragraph nine also explains that making a certain facial expression can cause you to feel that certain emotion. The FACS software is advanced enough where it could idnetify if a student is truly confused or not and it can help find new ways to teach by determining the sincere emotion of every student.\\n\\nThe article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" introduces the Facial Action Coding System, FACS, that helps identify human emtions. This software can be beneficial in many wyas, such as in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System can be used to read the emtions of students in a classroom to provide information on how students feel about certain classes and topics and challenges, and to provide on how classes can be taught differently.

To some or most a stament like this may seem outlandish or absurd. We use cars for daily life, to make it through this world, whether its to work, school, the store, it seems almost impossible to live without one. Vauban, Germany is an upscale community of suburban pioneers who have simply given up their vehicles. As many as 70 percent of Vauban\\'s famalies do not own cars. Heidrun Walter, a resident and mother of two, says she is \"much happier this way\". So what it is that has caused many communites like Vauban to take the advantage of living without a car? Green House gases better known as smog, that is polluting our air that we breathe.\\n\\nIn some places like the beloved Paris, home of the Eiffel Tower, smog has gotten out of hand. Paris has even enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. After 4,000 drivers were fined and twenty seven had their cars impounded for their claimed reaction to the fine, the congestion was finally down 60 percent. Beijing, China, known for being the most polluted cities in the world the smog rivals. You might even see people wearing masks in Beijing for their own health and safety.\\n\\nBogota, Colombia has caught on and spread this idea to other countries as well. For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis allowed for a Day Without Cars. Not even rain or shine stopped Colombians from traveling accordingly. Instead of being pessimistic about traveling alternatively most Colombian see it as a good opprutunity to take away stress and lower smog. So, imagine a day without cars in the bustling city of our own, maybe like Detroit. Well it seems that President Obama is catching on.\\n\\nRecent studies suggest a drop in Americans getting licenses\\', buying cars, and driving all together as years pass. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and is dropping from there steadily. Could it be that Americans love for cars is simply not what it used to be? Or is it that more alternate and practical ways of travel are now being provided and accepted widely? Either way if our country keeps up the good work sociologist believe it will have \"beneficical implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment\".

We made this conclusion when we first snapped a picture 10x faster of the face, we also took a second look and picture, and it has simalarites like a natural landform from the Snake River Plain of Idaho on Earth. But, there are people that think our conclusion to this is a conspiracy theory.\\n\\nIn 1998 on April 5, for the first time, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia.

Yet again Garvin said, \" If there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were.\"\\n\\nScientist said that the \"face\" was equivalent to a butte or mesa.

In the following paragraphs I will tell you about the evidence, the camera technology, and how the media affected the responds of people.\\n\\nMany people will argue that the mesa on Mars is a face. Although it may look like a face, it isn\\'t. In paragraph 1 it says, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia...\" This quote tells us that the scientists were used to seeing these large landforms around the region.

In Paris smog levels have gotten so high, that people have been asked not to drive their cars, in order to reduce pollution levels.\\n\\nIn the United States, the number of miles driven peaked in 2005, but has dropped nine percent since then.

The world is changing for the better and one of the machines man created, that is one of the world changing invenions of it\\'s time is coming down for it\\'s throne is the car. So what are the reasons for not getting a car? lets find out.\\n\\nIn Germany, that is coming faster than people think. An idea called \"Smart planning\\' is taking hold in an exprimental town bulit in 2006 named Vauban. A place were cars are a thing of the past. People everyday are not driving to school or work they are walking, bicycling, or taking the tram into the town from the suburb. Smart planning is revoultionary buliding towns to not be dependent on driving. 70% of Vauban\\'s famlies do not own car and are much happier to not have the everyday anxiteys of driving a motor engine car everyday. 57% sold there car just to move into the small town of Vauban. Car free suburbs and town are a growing trend all across Europe, the united states and many more nations. These efforts have been making cities, towns, and suburbs denser so you don\\'t have to go far to get some milk and eggs.\\n\\nThe global warning is a huge part of the fight to make the earth our home more better and healthier for generations and generations to come.

Congestion went down after the experiment. What was to blame for the smog was the Diesel fuel being used in most cars because of the fact that a tax policy favors diesel fuel over gasoline. Paris having more smog than the typical capital had a decrease in congestion and the citiy after enormous victory decided to go at it again and do odd numbered license cars.\\n\\nThe car culture is one the has had enormous effect on the everyday lives citizens around the world.

      "{'inputs.question': 'The Electoral College is best described as outdated and obsolete. It was designed so that, when there were too many states and poor technology, the vote could be fairly and reallistically counted, by voting between a few people from each state. This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the all-or-nothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information.\\n\\nWhen the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccouted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notecard that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, reciept, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue \"Enter\" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it\\'s results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we?\\n\\nThe electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state. He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat\\'s vote, his wife\\'s vote, the democratic guy who works at 7-11 down the street\\'s vote, Joe\\'s vote, Bob\\'s vote, Billy\\'s vote, \"That girl Suzie\\'s\" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. But wait! there\\'s more. Most states have an all-or-nothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair. It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called \"swing states,\" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state\\'s votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 1700-1800.

      "{'inputs.question': 'The limitation of car use provides many improvements to our envionment and health. Many different places have now started to get into the habit of preferring to use bicycles, car-pools, or even walking. Limiting car use could lead to less polution, more activity, and even safety. If we were to limit the use of cars, we could save many lives, including our own. While limiting the usage of cars many doors could open that leads many different places. Limiting cars could possibly terminate childhood and adulthood obesity. It could also provide happiness and joy, and even willing exercise. Cars both hinder, and help us, it gets the people where they need to go, but it ruins the environment and makes many people\\xa0 lathargic.\\n\\nWith the limitation of cars comes the major improvement on polution.\\n\\n\"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\" (1, Rosenthal). Passenger cars are responsible for 12 precent of the greenhouse emissions found in Europe, and where most cars are used the greenhouse gass emissions are up to 50 percent. The amount of gas that is polluting the air is asoultly hazardous to the health of many people. \"...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\" (1, Duffer). Paris eventually needed to ban driving due to the smog that was being produced from the cars. As stated in the ariticle, \"...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants\" (1, Rosenthal). If we were to limit the car usage, many smog and greehouse gases would not be as much of an issue as it is now. If we were to limit the usage of cars and prefer to car-pool, alot of gas, money, and lives. With the limiting of car usage comes the possibility of living a longer, healthier life without pollution tearing a hole in the ozone layer.\\n\\nLimiting the use of cars can also produce more activity among the people and hapiness. Limiting the use of cars forces many people to start walking, using trains, running, and even bicycling. As states in the article, \"New York\\'s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nations\" (1, Rosenthal). Many places are now starting to realize that the people are slowly loosing interest in cars and now perfer to walk, run, or even take public transportation. As stated in the articaly, \"..millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work leaving a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.... \\'It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\\'\" (1, Selsky). \"It has seen the construction of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American cirt....Parks and sports centers also have bloomes throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" (1, Selsky). Many citizens are starting to prefer to walk rather than drive. The perople are slowly moving away from motor vehicles and are starting to go outside and to exercise. As mentioned in the article, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" (1, Rosenthal) This choice is making alot most people happy and satified.\\xa0 Many people no longer need to fret about gas money or traffic, or even about arriving on time. Having no car is a stress-reliever that saves you time, stress, and keeps you from pulling at your hair. Exercising is also a much easier way to be able to blow off steam and reduce stress.\\n\\nAnother positive of limiting car use is the safety that is provided. Many Americans are now choosing to not recieve a license. The people are slowly moving away from the driving of cars and are now preferring to use public transportation, or even walking. People are now slowly starting to center their lives around where it could be easy to transport. Their place of work could now be centered around where public transport is able to drop them off, a walking distance, or even on the normal route that a friend, whom you could be able to catch a ride, wouldn\\'t mind dropping you off at. As stated in the article, \"They organize their summer jobs and soical life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends\" (1, Rosenthal).\\xa0 Another reason why many people do not drive, is due to the fact that many families and people cannot afford a vehicle, or they choose to not purchase one. As stated in the artice, \"\\'What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn\\'\" (1, Rosenthal). With less amount of people on the road, this lowers the possible chances of someone being in an accident. The possibility of poeple being in car accident have been lowered, because a majority of the people are refusing to drive. As mentioned in an artice, \"When adjusted to the population growth, th enumber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short...the number of miles driven perperson was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995\" (1, Rosenthal). If the people were to drive less this would mean less accidents and less pollution which could lead to lenghtier lives and to healthier lives.\\n\\nIn conclusion, with the limitation on the use of automobiles comes the many possibilities that could possibly save lives and re-shape them into something much more healthier. While reducing the usage of automobiles comes exercise and the relief os stress. Maybe childhood or adulthood obesity would not be as large of an issue if were reduced car usage. Many people could then be healthier and more involeved in their communities. With the limitation of car usage comes the unlimited possibilities.

      "{'inputs.question': 'A computer can tell the Mona Lisa painting is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. A computer is a complex machine with almost everything in it. A computer stores information like what sites you have been on, documents, and more. It also lets you get information in less than five seconds, but is this a good idea to use in classrooms with students? By looking at the reading \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" we can see how computers are helpful when it comes to students\\' expressions; the teachers can change the lesson up to make it more exciting on the spot.\\n\\nThe software that can read people\\'s emotions is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang, who worked with Professor Nicu Sebe on this project. They are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an \\'action unit.\\' Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\" All of their research on human expressions went into this software. They noticed your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you are surprised and your orbicularis oris tightens when you show anger. By using the software on the Mona Lisa painting, they predicted how she was feeling. She was more happy than angry according to the software, but by looking at the painting, a human can not tell if she is happy, angry,or sad. The computer can tell us how she is feeling by acknowledging her muscles in her face. This software can also tell us when a student is happy, confused or bored, and it will help the teacher adjust the lesson for the student. \"A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confued or bored.\\' Dr. Huang predicts. \\'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\". The technology can help a teacher and a student succeed together by telling each other how they are feeling even if they do not talk during class. Most students raise their hands to answers questions, but a student will not raise their hand to say \"I\\'m bored\". Some students do not want to tell the teacher they are confused either. Hence for the computer will automatically tell the teacher and they can explain the lesson better to the whole class because there are always multiple students who need extra help, but will not ask. There for, their software will make humans interact more by telling us how they are feeling.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the software Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe will help read students\\' emotional expressions. The software has information on how a humans\\' muscles move when they are happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprised, confused, etc. By using it on the Mona Lisa, we can see that the software works and it will also help find problems in it. Dr. Huang predicts that the software will also help the teacher know when a student is confused or bored. The teacher can then adjust their lesson to make the student more attentive.

This software can detect what kind of emotion you are feeling. This latest innovation comes from two profesors and some colleague experts. They are all developing better ways for a computer to communicate with people. The use of this technology could and should be used to even read students facial expressions in a classroom.\\n\\nMy first reason as to why I believe that this latest technology should be used to read students facial expressions in a classroom is because it can modify the lesson. For example when a student is in class and is looking at a computer screen and becoming confused or bored the computer will recognize this. When it recognizes this it can than modify the lesson in a way where it can make that frown go upside down. The lesson will than become more interesting and the student will than be willing to do the work because he/she enjoys it.\\n\\nMy second reason on why the Facial Action Coding System should be used in a classroom to detect students facial expressions is because it will help them academicly. For example when a student has to work on something on the computer that is visually interesting he/she will do a better job on actaully putting in some effort. The computer will read the facial expression on the student and continue giving them things on the screen that will keep a smile on there face. This will result in the student scoring well in whatever it was they were working on because it drew there attention in enough for them to continue reading and looking at the screen.\\n\\nIn conclusion using the Facial Action Coding System has its benifits.When using this new technology in a classroom the students will not only be happy but it will help them do well in school as well.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Dear Senator,\\n\\nConcerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is \"an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.\" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States\\' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.\\n\\nForemost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter\\'s representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee. Richard Posner in his publication \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" states that, \"it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote.\" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, \"yet, that has happened very rarely.\" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a \"winner-take-all\" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one\\'s ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that \"the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population.\" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, \"practical\" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,\" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that \"only educated voters should decide the election,\" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.\\n\\nLarge states also play a role in the EC\\'s inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state\\'s population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.\\n\\nUnderstanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.\\n\\nYours,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME    ', 'score': '6', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '5158', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

They also believe that Venus have been one of the earth like planet. They believe thast Venus had largely oceans and that there have had been life before that we don't know about.Another reason why NASA wants to go to venus is becuase they saw that venus had a surface of rocky sediment and it seem like valleys and mountains seem to be there.\\n\\nThis makes NASA even more interesting in going there. Going to Venus can be very dangerous in the excerpt it says that the\\n\\nregular temperature of a planet is 800 degrees fahrenheit and Venus is 90 times greater. Thse conditions are far more extreme than anything humas encounter on earth but they are still willing to take risk.\\n\\nThe Astronmers are willing to take the risk of trying to go to Venus to find answers to there questions.

Dr. Huang says \" A clasroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" This can help the teacher in order to realize what they can do to make the lesson more fun like helping the students engage more. Also this can just help the teacher know what they can go over in order to make the students understand certain lessons more.\\n\\nThis technology can help more so with the teacher because it is there job to help students when they do not understand something and to make the classroom learning process easier.

The Electoral College is a process of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress (office of the federal Register 2). In source two it announces that the electoral college is an unfair way to votes. In my opinion I agree strongly with that statement because not everyone would get a fair oppurtunity.\\n\\nSecondly, everyone has the right to voice their opinion on who they want to elect as president. With the Electoral College we wouldn\\'t be able to voice our opinion as because as Source 2 explains that if you have Electoral College system the voters would vote for a slate of electors, but not for president. The state of electors would be the ones to elect the president. Therefore the people wouldnt get a voice to vote only the 29 people in Florida-shown on the map in source 3-not the whole state which makes it not an equal oppurtinuty to everyone who lives in that state.\\n\\nNext, when having Electoral College instead of population vote the picked voters could pick someone wrong. In source two it mentions that sometimes the senator could vote for the wrong person sometimes and not always can they control their vote. To add on to that the electoral college is the \"disaster factor\". The reason that it is the diaster factor is because the state legislatures are responsible for picking the electors and they could pick everyone thats agasinst a certain president and that the \"better\" president isn\\'t picked and has a chance of our state being ruined.\\n\\nFinally, my fellow friends of the State Senator I persuade you in choosing to change electing the president to popular vote instead of continuing on with the Electoral College method.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Car Free Cities\\n\\nCould you imagine living in a place without cars? Or even in a place where there were cars,but nobody used them? That is not a place I would want to live in. I enjoy driving my car, and many of my friends enjoy cruising dirt roads in their trucks. Driving is not just a way of transportation, it is a way of life. There are some people that don\\'t want to drive. There are some people that don\\'t want anybody to drive. There are people and governments trying to take away the right to drive an automobile on certain days. It seems like a huge hit, which is good for the government promoting it, because if people had anything better to do, the idea wouldn\\'t last a second. Take the \"Car-free day\" in Bogota, Colombia for example. It was started in the mid-1990s. My source said that millions of Colombians took alternate approaches to getting around on this day. However, I must also take into consideration that this article was written in 2002. There has been a lot of change since 2002. In 2002 I didn\\'t even know how to ride a bicycle, and now I\\'ve got my driver\\'s license. I can\\'t really infer how many take part in this event nowadays, but it said millions participated twelve years ago. I would think that if that was the majority of people in the designated areas, then they would\\'ve wrote the impressive percentage of people that participated. However, they did not. The article just says millions. How many millions of people? Two million people, three millions people, ten million people? It doesn\\'t say how many millions as if to suggest that the writers of this article think that just writing \"millions\" of people is enough evidence to impress the reader. For all i know, only ten percent of the people in Colombia may have taken part in Car-free day. Also, it says the fine for violating the Car-free day is $25 dollars with the exception to buses and taxis. This sounds more to me like a scam to get people to use more buses and taxis. $25 dollars where I live isn\\'t hardly anything. I can find that much walking down the sidewalk. In Colombia, however, i do not know how much that is. Especially in the capitol city, where I\\'m sure there is plenty of poverty just as there is in the majority of large cities in the U.S. The article did not specify how much money $25 dollars is over there related to in the United States. So when it boils down to it, the citizens of Colombia didn\\'t have many choices for transportation. They could walk or ride a bicycle, probably the cheapest way. They could take a bus or taxi which would most likely be free, but it would be pointless because if the reason for this campaign is really what officials claim it is- to reduce pollution, then they\\'re just making it worse having people take buses instead of driving they\\'re own cars. I\\'m positive my car gets more mpg than the buses they\\'re using in Colombia. So I\\'m sure there were quite a lot of people that participated in the event, but I\\'m not convinces they all did it for the right cause.\\n\\nI am totally against taking away cars. I do not care if they take away cars in other countries. I think it would be wrong and unfair to the people, but it doesn\\'t apply to me, therefore I\\'m not concerned too much. However, if they tried to ban the use of cars in the U.S, I think there would be an outrage. My dad is a self-employed floor installer, but in his mean time he works on cars. He is good at working on cars. If he wanted to, he could easily open up a body shop out of his garage, but he doesn\\'t want to. He doesn\\'t want to work on cars for other people and he don\\'t care about the money he could make doing it. He wants to work on his own cars for no other reason than that he enjoys doing it. His dad taught him how to fix cars. My grandpa was also a mechanic before he retired. He had his own small-town body shop where people from all around would bring there cars for him to fix. He did very well financially for auto-mechanic. I do not share the same love for cars that they do. When i was growing up i didn\\'t want to be in a garage, i wanted to be in a pool or on a basketball court. That\\'s not to say that i don\\'t love my car though, and enjoy driving it. I\\'m sixteen years old, I\\'ve had my license for about six months, and I\\'ve had my own car for about 9 months. In source 4: The End of Car Culture, the author talks about her sons compared to Mr. Sivak\\'s sons. Her sons have little interest in obtaining a license. I know very few people like that in my life. Most of my friends and I love our automobiles and we love being able to drive. It\\'s a good sense of self-responsibility that prepares us for the responsibility we will encounter as adults.\\n\\nIn a world where everybody walks, bikes, hikes, or takes buses and taxis, I would be miserable. I would hate walking or biking to work everyday and everywhere I go. Every time i arrived i would be drenching in sweat. I would hate taking a bus just as much because it would most likely be crammed full of tons of people who are incapable or too lazy to walk and bike to get around. If buses today are already uncomfortable, could you imagine them twice as full? Taxis would probably be the worst. They would be the only means of comfortable transportation. Could you imagine the price of using a taxi in a world without private cars. It would skyrocket. The fare would be outrageous. I hope i never live to experience a time where i will get a ticket and fine just for driving my car on a certain day of the week.       \\xa0    ', 'score': '2', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '2.0', 'Line number': '5281', 'gpt_coherence_y': '2.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",
      "{'inputs.question': 'The face on Mars is a very interesting thing. It looks like a human head but there is now way it could be because it is two miles long. Some people say that is was made by aliens. NASA says that it is just a rock formation that happend naturaly. There are many arguments for both sides. I\\'m going to tell you the arguments from the side that says it is just a natural rock formation. This face on Mars is a natural rock formation because, if it were made by aliens than when they got close to it they would have saw things that would be unatural. Another reason is it looks like buttes and mesas that we have here in the United States. Lastly we have been studying this for twenty five years and never before has an alien came up and said, \"Hi I made this\".\\n\\nThe first reason why I thin that this was a natural formation is that we have gotten realy close to the formation and never have we seen any aliens or even any buildings other than the face. On April 8,2001 it was a cloudless summer dday in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \\x93We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\\x94 said Garvin. \\x93Malin\\x92s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera\\x92s absolute maximum resolution.\\x94 Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how close they got to the planet and they never had anything happen to the nor did they see anything. Thust proving my first point.\\n\\nAnother reason this formation is natural is that there are formation in the United States that have naturlay occured. Buttes and mesas look very similar to the face on Mars. This is what NASA says about it ,what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\\x97landforms common around the American West. \\x93It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\\x94 says Garvin. \\x93That\\x92s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\\x94 This shows that there are very simmilar things to the face in our world today. Thus proving my second point.\\n\\nLastly we have been studying this thing for twenty five years. NASA has been taking pictures of it for a long time now and they have not found any signs of life on Mars. Some people would say that NASA is hiding stuff. NASA would not hide stuff like this for many reasons. Here is what they say about it. The \\x93Face on Mars\\x94 has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows\\x97even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars\\x97evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Thus proving my third point.\\n\\nSo in conclusion there are no signs of alien life on the planet. This is how NASA concluded there point. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This proves that even though several people think that there is life on mars there is no life and this is a natural formation.

The question would be if the driverless cars were to get into an accident, whose fault would it be? If the human driver didn't cause it should the company get fault for it and even get sued? Or should the human driver take the blame since they are human and actually driving a car. The company who manufactured the car should take full responsibily with the accident.

Although the driverless cars have humans on standby, they still shouldn't be made because of all the safety hazards it could cause on the other people and the technology that was built into the car, its essentially a waste of money to make a car thats driverless and it gets wrecked beyond repair. With the laws that could be put into place if driverless cars become a thing of the 21st century, they can and will blame the company who made the car for it either malfunctioning or the human in the car not realizing there was iminate danger ahead. They wouldn't blame the person who was on the other side of the wreck because he knew what he was doing, the driverless car wouldn't know what it was doing. If that were to happen driverless cars would be illegal in all states not just in California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia.\\n\\nIn conclusion I think cars that are driverless should not be allowed to be a thing because of all the safety hazards and the complications it could cause.

Also, we shouldn\\'t have to live in this kind of environment, filled with smog, it\\'s very unhealthy to inhale these substances. Think about a world with no cars for a second like in Vauban, Germany; walking to work (which gets in a quick morning exercise), watching kids play with their friends outside, clear skies, oh and actually being able to take a deep breath without suffocating. These are all marvelous reasons to reduce car usage.\\n\\nThink of Earth before cars; there were clear skies, green views, blue seas, birds chirping in the morning. Nice right? Well, now come back to reality where the air is gray, the fields are covered with roads or dirt, the seas are filled with oil and the sea animals all fighting for their lives. According to experts, \"passengers are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in United States\". Is sitting in a car, being lazy, stuck in a traffic jam really worth this?

NASA is working on approaches to study Venus. They have some simplified electronics made out of silicon carbide and have been tested in a chamber that simulates the conditions of Venus´s surface. They lasted in the chamber for three weeks in such conditions. Which means that are more resistants to pressure, heat, and other forces.\\n\\nIn conclusion, human might have the power to go to Venus and study the planet. The temperatues may be around 170 degrees Fahrenhiet, but it still survivable for humans. With the technology and the brains we have, I am\\n\\npretty sure we´ll be able to land on Venus to expand space experation.

Also it isn\\'t a good aspect upon life because we as people want to feel 100% safe, and to trust technology is not a good idea. What will happen if the car disfunctions and dosen\\'t stop on time in an accident?\\n\\nAs it states in the article, \"why would anyone want a driveless car and still need a driver,\" because the manufactures of this driveless car company knows that it is not a 100% guarantee that the car will stop on time or keep you save from accidents. Even though it wouldn\\'t be one as of driving on your own, because you can\\'t help the faults of other drivers on the road, there still would be more accidents with a driveless car than it would be on our own, because you have full control of what you want to do with it. And this where the big question falls in, \"If technology fails and someone is injured who fault is it the driver or the manufactuer?\" It would be the maunfactuers because they say even with a driveless car the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation rquires for them to get into an accident.\\n\\nEven if the google car announces for them to be prepared and when to take action, don\\'t you think instead it should prepare itself to disregard getting into an accident. Before they even though about selling these cars and having people ride in them, they should\\'ve did a better investment and more use of technological differences to actually help citizens out. They could\\'ve even had the installation for the car to teach student learners how to drive with a person to test them in the car, because this technology of a driveless car is just not good enough. The manufactures also didn\\'t even have a thought to actually care for other citizens out there driving the car because if they did they would\\'ve had to car do everything needed to precaution itself from hazardous situations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this is why i strongly disagree for the manufacturing of driveless cars because it could tend to be very hazardous and it\\'s not good to belive in technology will save you. Also if it\\'s a driveless car why should you still have to have somebody in the car and have them still steer and take over in dangerous situations?

It may be the easiest way to get around but take the time out to think about the bad it cause. You wont be able to live some places because the wont have enough parking spaces. Where are you going to park? The diesel fuel you use to keep the car going pollute the air. Then we would have alot of bad air floatring around. Its also a problem to the traffic. Why not carpool, ride a bus, train, or bike? there are many different transportations in the world why just use one all the time?\\n\\nYou see, cars may be the easiest way to get around but let's study some of the bad. One reason limiting cars is an advantage is because if you don't have a car 9 times out of 10 it would be easier for you to stay anywhere. Some homing areas doesn't have enough land to make an parking lot. So if you see somewhere you would like to live without an parking lot who would probably have to find somewhere esle to live. You can slove that by just getting rid of your car. I understand that getting rid of your car would probably be the hardest thing you have ever done but look at the bright side. You would be living in the place you want to be living in.\\n\\nNot only would it be easy to find somewhere to stay but also you wont have to worry about polluting the air with diesel fuel. Its crazy how you spend 3 dollars for an gallon of gas just to pollute the air. You would be better off just spending 3 dollars to catch an city bus or train.

I mean for starters most voters are easily manipulated and indecicive, If we choose the vote by popularity method it\\'ll cause more of a problem then what we have now, and lastly not many people actually care for voting.\\n\\n\"The mob is stupid\". This is what my 7th grade civics people told everyone. People are easily tricked. Just got a nazi germany for example. People belived in his philosophy and led to Germanys down fall. Anybody could appeal to anybodys needs. All you have to say is what the people want to hear. How you conduct yourself and how you talk is all you need to make some one on your side or to catch a vote. The electoral system is basically a back up defense in this type of a situation.\\n\\nIn addition, a \"popular vote wins\" election it\\'ll cause\\' way more chaos than you could imagine. Like during the 2012 election obama only recieved 51.3% of votes. Can you belive that? Just 1.3% short was the opponent and you actually belive not only the people but Mitt Romney would accept his loss? He\\'d obviously demand for a recount and possibly even be calling so and so for being corrupt and it would be a wild two months if not four years .\\n\\nLastly, many people do not care for voting which not only decreases the number to manipulate makes it harder for an election to be one sided. About half of americas population actually vote on elections which actually increases the odds of tight races.\\n\\nTo wrap this up i belive the electoral system should be kept not only does it

Although they may be nice when you don't want to drive somewhere but need to go, I do not believe this is something Americans should be taking up for various reasons.\\n\\nFirst off, I do not think self-driving cars are very safe. If I were to be in a self driving car, I would not be able to relax and trust the car to do the driving, because i'd fear it hitting something causing an accident or just stopping in the middle of the road. Even if the car had automatic stop and auto break systems, I would still have to be very causious and keep my eyes on the road, which is similar to driving a car, so why not save the anxiousness and drive? I believe Americans are getting more and more lazy, therefore they want a self driving car instead of just driving themselves. I think that driving yourself and making sure you are safe, is much better of an idea than putting you're trust in a computerized car. Many questions come to mind when I think about self driving cars.\\n\\nA question that comes to mind while thinking of driverless cars is, whose fault is it if an accident is caused? Would you blame yourself for the accident or the cars since it was driving? Many problems would arise when dealing with this. For example, if the car industry blames the accident on the person, the person could sue the car company stating that it was the car in control, therefore not being the persons fault, it would be the cars. On the other hand, car industries could argue that the person should've been paying attention to the road, and not putting in their full trust with the car.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there is a lot to think about when dealing with driverless cars, whoses fault accidents would be, what the new age limit for driving would be, and also whether or not to put you're trust into these cars. Many problems and conflicts would occur, therefore I believe the people should stick to driving the cars. How hard is it to drive a car by ourselves, do we really need the help, or are we just too lazy to want to drive places? Although I admit it would be nice to not have to drive when going on long distance trips, I dont think i'd be able to trust the car to drive for me, and I wouldn't be able to relax when dealing with a self-driving car, even if it had been tested multiple times.

This would be persuasive because if you had been to the program, you coud tell people about how you helped your country and how you were a brave hero they might also want to be able to help their country and join the program. I can support my claim because in the text it tells us that Luke and Don were traveling to Europe and World War II had just happned there so Luke and Don had signed up to be Seagoing Cowboys to help deliver food and water and live stock to Europe.\\n\\nAnother reason people should join the program is because It's lots of fun to be on board! I can support my evidence because in the text it tells us that while Luke was on board, the cowboys played baseball, volleyball, and games in the empty holds where the animals used to be housed. It also tells us that table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittiling, and other games also helped pass the time.\\n\\nOne of the final ways you could persuade folks to join the program is that while serving, you can also go sight-seeing! The text evience i used was from paragraph 5. The text tells me that besides helping people, Luke also got to see the Acropolis is Greece, took a gondola ride through Venice,Italy, toured the castle in Crete, and marvled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.\\n\\nThis is what i belive to be the most effective ways to persuade people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program and how to tell them in a posotive way that this helps you to meet new people, protect your country, and go sight-seeing all why having a great time.      \", 'score': '3', 'gpt_coherence_x': '5.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '5858', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '3.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",

      "{'inputs.question': '\"All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change,\" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.\\n\\nTo start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of near-record pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.\\n\\nNext, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay $40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih even-numbered license plates could drive one day and odd-numbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some\\xa0 reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota\\'s car-free day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.\\n\\nTo conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Dear State Senator,\\n\\nEver since our founding fathers established in the constitution that the president and vice president votes were determined by electoral college, the founding fathers made a good decision. Electoral College is a process where electors gather for a meeting and count the electoral votes to determine the new president and vice president. The United States should keep Electoral College to determine the president and vice president rather than a popular vote because Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote.\\n\\nTo start off, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than popular votes because electoral college avoids run-off elections. If somebody was running for either president or vice president and they recieved thirty percent in popular votes, nobody would know if the person with thirty percent popular vote would win the election. Electoral College prevents confusion by producing a clear winner. For example, in source 3, the text reads \"Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992 had only forty-three percent of popular votes but both had three-hundred and plus electoral votes which made them win the election\". The president and vice president make sure our country is running well and that we as a country have no problems. If we were to determine our president and vice president by a popular vote, whoever could kiss up more to the voters would win the election even if the person running doesn\\'t meet up to the qualifacations of the person they are running against. Avoiding a run-off election is very important because no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Also, if a popular vote was how the president and vice president were decided, not as much people would pay attention to voting because voters have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign of the people running for president and vice president.\\n\\nFurthermore, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than a popular vote because Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote. In 2008 when Barack Obama won his election to become the 44th president of the United States, he didn\\'t win by being the popular canadite, Obama won by his passion to make this country better than it already is. For example, in source 1, the text reads \"The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president\". That way of electing the president is more fair than a popular vote because you need 270 electors to say yes to make you president rather than people making you president by if your popular or not. Electoral College is what keeps our elections fair. There is no other way to elect somebody president becuase no other method will be this successful than Electoral College. After all, Electoral College has been the way to elect the president since the constitution was created. Popular Voting is a bad method if were used to determine the president and vice president because somebody who is running for president can manipulate people to think he or she is a good canidate for president when they really aren\\'t.\\n\\nTo conclude, Electoral College should continue to decide the president rather than popular votes becuase Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than popular votes. Why should we change the way we elect president if this method has been working for over 200 years? Electoral College should continue to decide the presidency for years to come because it works so well.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Having a machine called \" Facial Action Coding System\" Is cool dont get me wrong but having it in a classroom full of emotional teenagers is not a very good idea. It is not a good idea because for one no one wants everyone to know how they are actually feeling, they want them to think they are okay when they really arent. Secondly their is really nothing to do when a teenager is out of a lesson or very tired. Lastly the computur could be wrong , you cant trust everything a computer says to you.\\n\\nHaving a computer read teenagers emotions is pointless. We are 15-18 all of us have mixed emotions 24/7. You could be happy one second and angry the next minute, you just cant control your emotions sometimes. With the computer reading your emotions some kids might get mad and say thats a lie to cover up how they really feel. No teenager wants anyone to know how they feel unless it is their best friends.Would you want everyone to see how you actually are, and then everyone try and comfort you if your more sad than happy? I know I would not like that, no one would.\\n\\nSecondly it is a bad reason to have a computer tell your emotions because nothing is going to stop you from being tired/ bored. When your out of it , your out out. Trying to make stuff more fun to get you awake or louder will just annoy the person so much.Teenagers stay up late all the time on their phone, or playing video games or just hanging out with friends.Having bright lessons, or loud lessons can really make a teenager angry and they will throw a big fit and get kicked out of class. A computer had to tell that he was tired and bored and now he/she is kicked out of class. Teachers can already see kids are tired everyday and bored, but you have to teach the lesson even if they are passed out or bored. Its a part of highschool. Computers changing the lessons could basically mean that they can stop hiring teachers because a machine can teach the lesson and\\n\\nmake it less boring ,\" \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored ,\" Dr.Huang predicts.\" Then it could motify the lesson , like an effective human instructor.\" You cant just get rid of teachers , eberything online could just make us distracted and do anything else.\\n\\nIve always heard since elemantry , \" Dont trust everything on the internet.\" So why should us the teenagers trust the computer when it gives us our precentage of happy, mad, or sad. The computer could have a glitch or someone could be around you and it picks up both your emotions and adds them together. Even though the computer described the mood for Mona lisa , \" Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.\" you cant beleive that, that was painted so long ago you dont know he actual emotions its just a picture. Anyone can act how ever they want in a photo. Trusting this computer percentage would be hard it can play mind games on you, saying your 80% sad, then your mind will believe your sad. So then your sad the rest of the day. Your mind plays tricks on you.\\n\\nThose are the reasons I believe having a computer describe our emotions is pointless. For one every teenager has so many emotions right now. Secondly trying to make the lesson more bright or loud to wake kids up might make them angry.

The author said that \"His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code\". This software system will help show the expression of a student in a classroom. It can tell if the student is feeling happy or sad. If the computer can tell wheater the student is bored or happy it can change the impact of how the computer can change to make them happy. For example, when you smile when the web ad comes up, the similar one will pop up. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\\n\\nIn the conclusion, now you know why the Facial Action Coding is valuable. It can tell different action of emotion of a student in class.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Many cities are experiencing perhaps the biggest economic change being implemented into society since the invention of the Model T. People just simply aren\\'t interested in attaining a personal vehicle, or even a license for that matter. As a result, many personal vehicle companies are starting to become more \"mobile\" to stay with the times, or become bankrupt due to being stagnant in sales. Not owning a car has actually proved to come with more advantages than if owning a car. Such as, less carbon emissions in the air, less stress in certain communites where car-free zones are being implemented, and finally restaurants and stores becoming more \"cropped up\" due to rush-hour restrictions; essentially boosting the economy.\\n\\nThe lack of car use has fundamentally benefitted the environment as an entirety. Cars emit carbon emissions into the air that are not only harmful to many animals, but to humans as well. According to Source 2, in Paris, France alone, it was shown that \"due to the use of diesel fuel over regular fuel, there were 147 micrograms of particle matter per cubic meter.\" Comparing this to other major cities in Europe that find more use for regular gasoline, you\\'ll find that the results are less. In Brussels, there were 114 micrograms of PM per cubic meter, and in London, 79.7. Even though areas that used more regular fuel over diesel fuel were significantly lower in micrograms of particle matter, even 79.7 micrograms can be potentially fatal, and cause lung-related health problems in the later lives of the people occupying these areas. Officials not only in Paris, but also in major cities such as Bogota, Colombia and New York City, New York have also began to take a stand. In Paris, France for example, \"there are certain days in which cars cannot be driven by people with license plates ending in even numbers, and the next day by people with license plates ending in odd numbers. This new way of thinking has been implemented into the French law system to help decrease the amount of pollution in the air.\" (Source 2) Bogota has also found a unique approach to a less polluted environment. \"Car-free day is a day in which no cars are driven, with the exception of buses and taxis.\" (Source 3) Finally, New York City has implemented a \"new bike-sharing program in which bicycles can be rented for a cost-effective amount. In addition to this, bridge and tunnel tolls have also reflected these new priorities by skyrocketing in price.\" (Source 4) These new implementations have proved beneficial in decreasing the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Many communities have not only found a way to reduce pollution in the air, but also live a more stress-free lifestyle.\\n\\nStress and rush-hour are known to have some corollation, but newer communites are starting to take a stand by limiting the amount of car usage in their area. Vauban, Germany, a newer community only just established in 2006, is an example of one of these communites that has started to \"smart plan.\" Over 70 percent of Vauban\\'s occupants don\\'t own a car, and 57 percent have sold a car to move there.\" (Source 1) A happier lifestyle has appeared as a result. According to Heidrun Walter, an occupant in Vauban. When she had a car, she was always \"tense.\" But now, she\\'s a much happier mother of two, and the distant hum of an occasional motor vehicle is drowned out by the \"chattering of wandering children.\" (Source 1) In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is suggesting that we start implementing these \"car reduced\" communities in our nation to better society, as well as to provide a more stress-free environment for these new communites\\' residents. (Source 1) Even in Bogota, people have said that the use of no cars is a \"great opportunity that has taken away stress and lowered air pollution.\" (Source 3)\\n\\nNot only has pollution been reduced in all of this or the fact that a factor attributing to stress has also been removed, but areas where these communites are starting to form, have also boosted the economy. In Bogota, it has been reported that due to Car-free day, that both \"parks and sports centers have started to appear throughout the city. In additon to this, sidewalks have been replaced by more broad, smooth sidewalks. As well as, rush-hour traffic has been cut, allowing new restaurants and upscale shopping districts to flourish.\" (Source 3) \"Cars are starting to become a thing of the past,\" according to Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. Even her children (19 and 21) don\\'t have licenses. \"They say they\\'re interested, but it\\'s not a priority for them,\" she later goes on to say. As a result, gas money is saved, and people can spend more money on things that matter to them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it has been displayed that the advantages of not using a car are starting to outweight the benefits. The lack of car use in these car-free communities is helping to reduce stress and tension on the road, boost not only the community\\'s economy, but also the entire nation\\'s economy as well. In addition to this, the lack of car use is also helping to preserve the environment, by reducing carbon emissions into the air. According to many sociologists and business professionals, the downfall of the car may well be on its way, but it may not be such a bad thing.       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0    ', 'score': '5', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '6647', 'gpt_coherence_y': '5.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

      "{'inputs.question': 'The use of cars has always affected society greatly. There are plans constantly being added to better the environment without the use of cars. Vauban, mentioned in Source 1, can be the start of the car-less world we want to live in. As this expiriment becomes noticed by the world, communities will realize how beneficial this experiment could be. Think about a world with no cars. There would be less pollution and less gasses being emitted into the air. For example, Pairs has just banned driving due to heavy smog. After about five days, car traffic was down 60 percent. Limiting car usage should be implemented heavily because of the greenhouse gas emissions and the happiness of the citizens of Vauban.\\n\\nTo begin with, cars cause many problems and the most important being the emissions of greenhouse gasses. As seen in Source 1, some of the car fillled cities of the United States suffer from up to 50 percect of greenhouse gas emissions. Well-populated cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago could be in great danger. A highly populated city in Colombia, has a \"Car-Free\" day. The goal of this is to allow people to open their eyes and realized how many alternative ways there are to go to work. The implimented a fee of 25 dollars to anyone who violated. I think that by adding a fee, the outcome would be greater and more people would participate. This is a great idea that would open people up to other options. For example, on the third year of the car free day, two other cities joined Bogota. Sometimes we have to open up the eyes of others to really see the change. Also, parks and recreational areas have opened up, uneven sidewalks have been referbished, and most importantly the city has less traffic.\\n\\nContinuing with pollution, Paris had a near-record of pollution, seen in Source 2. This led to the ban of driving. The ban of driving could be refered to as the limiting of driving. They set up a plan in which cars with even-numbered license plates couldn\\'t drive on Mondays. The same occured for the odd-numbered license plates on Tuesday. They heavily enforced this by implimenting a fine of 22 euros if they used their cars. This idea could work here in America. It would open up carpooling and lessen the amount of cars on the road.\\n\\nPeople such as David Goldberg, mentioned in Source 1, are pushing for citites to be less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg mentions the hybrid car. Even though buying a hybrid does not reduce the amount of cars, it does reduce the amount of green house gas emissions.\\n\\nSeeing the happiness and comfort that the people of Vauban allows us to see what our society could look like. We could live in a society just like theirs, filled with nature. In the United States, the number of licenses has been going down each year. Now, this does not automatically mean that American citizens want to \"be green\". It could be simply because of the fact that cars are expensive, and because we are living in a rough situation.

In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes.Within 10 years, those sensers had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers.\\n\\n\"The psychogical aspect of automation are really a challenge,\" admits Dr.Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver.\" We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way.\" Some manufacuers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over--somthing not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way , the in-car system is acutally a safety feature.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driveless cars are much safer that car that have to have a driver .When you thing about the pros and cons you start to see that there are more pros that cons.

This new technology is valuable because it could help further learning, introduce new technology, and make a interesting subject.\\n\\nFirst of all, the article explains that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. It's crazy how a computer can configure that. If this is brought into classrooms, this could be a gamebreaker. This is a plus for kids that may not have access to computers at home, to give them technology at school. In paragraph 4, Dr. Huang says people show different degrees of expressions. He says a computer uses video imagery can track facial movement.\\n\\nNext, this new process may bring in new technology and promote computer use. In paragraph 2 and 3, the article states that you can calculate an expression similar to math homework. This wil not only promote the use of technology, but it may get kids to do their homework. If this interests children enough to get them to do their homework, it could promote new classes for them to take.\\n\\nMoving on to the next topic, creating new topics. If kids really like to examine peoples expressions, not only will it be amazing but it could create a whole new field of learning. Similar to a crime investigator, they could literally investigate someone's face to see what their expression is. In paragraph 5, the article digs deeper into the investigation. It explains that you can tell if a friend is happy or sad, by looking at their facial expression. If this was taken to a new level, we could have profesionals on our hands, just by making a class for it.\\n\\nTo conclude the topic, reading a facial expression by using a computer, or just by looking deeper into somones face, could take you far.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Many people in the world today think that cars and driving everywhere is a necessity; however, many people feel that owning a car is \"impractical (and) undesirabe.\" (paragraph 43) There are many advantages to having cars, but there are also many more advantages to not using cars wherever people go. Some advatages include conserving resources, making people have a little more money in their pocket and it also improves safety in many suburban cities.\\n\\nIn the world today, a major problem that still exsists is greenhouse gases. Cars emit a lot of gas that isn\\'t good for the enviroment. In the first source, it says that people living in cities \"is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes... passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent...in Europe...and up to 50 percent... in the United States.\"(paragraph 5) Exports mean to say that it is better for people to live in cities so they don\\'t have to drive everywhere. This means that the more people that live in cities, the less gas goes into the air. In Paris, the city issued a ban for driving to try and reduce the smog. The second source says that \"congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog.\" (paragraph 14) Only after five days of the no driving ban, more than half of the smog was gone in Paris. It also says that the amount of smog was almost as polluted at the city of Beijing, China, which is the most polluted city in the world. Bogota also did the same thing. They have an event called \"A Day Without Cars.\" Participant Carlos Arturo Plaza says it is a good way \"to take away stress and lower air pollution.\"(paragraph 24) They also got other cities, and even other countries, to follow suit and join the event. America faces the same problem as Paris; too many greenhouse gases are being put into the atmosphere. President Obama has a goal that he wasnts to achieve and\\xa0 that is to try and make the enviroment healthy. The last article says that driving less \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants.\"(paragraph 34) This implies that the amount of gases let into the air will be reduced. If peolpe didn\\'t drive as much from place to place, the world would be a happier, healthier place.\\n\\nApart from the fact that cars give of gas, not driving everwhere also means people save more money. In Vauban, Germany, nobody has any cars, they walk or bike to wherever they need to go. \"Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the egde of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.\"(paragraph 2) People would be more inclined to not getting a car rather than spend an extra 40 grand on top of getting a house for a parking space. Also, in Paris, a fine was issued for people who drove their cars during the car ban. The second article says \"even-number license plastes were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine..\"(paragraph 11) If people didn\\'t drive their cars around when they weren\\'t supposed to, they would still have the 22 euros they lost. The same type of fine was issued in Bogota, Columbia. If people drove their cars on \"A Day Without Cars\", then they would have to face a $25 fine. However, in the United States, \"recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\"(paragraph 29) Without having to pay for a car or gas money, Americans are saving way more money they had been when they first got a car. Wit people not having to worry about payments or gas prices, they have more money in their wallet.\\n\\nNot only does not driving save money and reduce gas, it also improves cities and people\\'s lives. Heidrun Walter, a German media trainer, says that \"when (she) had a car, (she) was always tense. (She\\'s) much happier this way.\" (paragraph 3) She likes not having to drive everywhere, it makes her feel more calm and less tense. It\\'s not only changing peoples lives, but it\\'s changing the cities. Cities are attempting \"to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with eless space for parking.\"(paragraph 6) Cities are changing their apperance in order to intice people into driving less and walking or biking more. They intend to make the stores closer together rather than having to drive across the highway to get to the next store. Also in Bogota, there has been a \"cunstruction of 118 miles of bicycle paths\" and \"parks and sports centers...have bloomed throughout the city.\"(paragraphs 27&28) With more people walking, the city wants to make the outside apperance different and more appealing than what it looked like before people just used cars. Not driving is not only good for personal well being, but for the a city\\'s well being.\\n\\nThere are many advantages to driving cars, such as saving time and getting to places faster but, not driving cars is way better in the long run because of a better enviroment, saving money and better cities and personal health.

These advantages include less problems with our environment, and with our society.\\n\\nWhen it comes to greenhouse gasses, remember that there is carbon monoxide, which is a greenhouse gas, coming out from the tailpipe of the cars.

      "{'inputs.question': 'The electoral college has been around for as long as our nation has reined over this land. I fervently believe we should keep the electoral college as it is. We, as people, are not ready for the responability of choosing our next leader directly viva popular vote. Some of us might be ready for this responability now, but the magority of America cannot handel this responibity. The majority has stared riots over lost football games, acknolaged said riots and justifyed them then turn around and see a riot about a kid being shot 6 times by an officer and send in swat teams and start throwing smoke bombs. Because of these actions and the many like it, I whole-heartedly believe if we leave the responability to chose our president in the magority vote that this country will become more unstable than it already it because, most people already do not vote, some are biast, and some dont follow the consititution when they vote.\\n\\nTo begin with, letting the majority vote on our new president would have potential if the whole of the country voted, but alas only a small essence of the country votes for our future leaders. Most people are too busy, or lazy, or just dont want to take part in voting becuse of all of the conficting ads placed on television. One of the most atrocious of these ads was the one from mitt romney when he was in the race against President Obama. They put these ads on a chanel designated for familys to veiw, along with children. These ads inculded vivid pictures of aborted fetus, saying this is what would happen if we voted for obama. I\\'ve only saw that ad once, but once was more than enough to make me side with Obama more than I already was. If our president is prepared to threten the country like that then they should not be eligable to even run, let alone become President, and it was horendus to think of all of the children watching at the time to have to see that. Most Americans who are eligable to vote have full-time jobs, full-time school, or are busy in some other aspects of life. These people do not have the time to vote for our president becuase they are working at the time, most work one or two jobs at the least, leaving little time for social graces and time alone, let alone time to vote. One other reason citizens dont vote is just hte sheer fact that they are lazy. A good precetage of Americans just do not care about who our president is or who runs for office, thus not voting out of sheer laziness.\\n\\nFurthermore, letting the majority vote rule who is our president would have potential if the majority of America was not biased in who they vote for. Almost all Americans have voted baised on their beliefs, or who is running for president. These are the people who voted agaoinst obama becuase of his ethnic background, or what he looked like. This should not go against who we vote for, or who leads us, as long as they are non-biased in what they stand for and have the good of the people in their minds, then they should be eligable, or even voted, as a canidate/president/offical.\\n\\nTo continue, letting the majority vote on our new president would have potential if the majority of Americans followed the consititution when voting. The majority does not follow the consitiution when voting for our new president, thus inducing an unfair campaine and an biased leader. The consitiution clearly states the Church and State are to be seperated, yet many Americans vote baised on the beliefs of their Church on matters of the State. The latest case of this happening was for the ban on gay marrige. Most voters voted in favor of the ban due a passage in the bible that stated that man shall not lay with another man as he lays with a woman, even though there is a homosexual couple in the bible, mathew/mathius something. The story aout a man named Dave and another named John, if i remember correctly, one of them said \"your love exceeds that of a woman\" or something close to that. There are a number of testiments that say not to judge others or to love everyone, but most focus on the one against those. Baising your vote on spiritual beliefs does not help anyone and is unfair towards those whos lifes you are negativly affecting. We should all think logically when voting for our leaders, and ask questions like \\'who will this affect\\' \\'how will this improve apon the lifes of my fellow Americans\\' \\'will this improve our dilapitiating economy and crippling structe of the government\\' along with other questions that relate to how this canidate will improve apon the country as a whole.\\n\\nAll in all, I believe that the electoral college should stay in affect untill America, as a whole, grows up, becuase most dont vote, some who vote are biased, and some dont follow the consitiution when voting. We should not have to write papers on why we shouldnt let the people of America vote directly for our leader, nor should we have to have our rights taken away from those who use their religous prectices as an excuse to hate someone.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Driverless cars will be the future of driving, and could potentially make driving a safer task. Driverless cars will have a positive impact on the world because of the ecological benefits that will result as an outcome of the mobilization of driverless cars, along with the safety benefits that will help resolve many of driving\\'s biggest issues, mainly crashes.\\n\\nPollution is a big concern of many people living in the world today, and cars are\\n\\nmajor producer of pollution through burning fuel. One benefit that driverless cars will have is that according to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, \"The [driverless cars]... would use half the fuel of today\\'s taxis\" (Driverless cars are coming). A big problem that many people see today is the concern of fossil fuel pollution. According to Sergey Brin, driverless cars could potentially help resolve or contribute less to pollution, because they, in theory, produce less fuel emissions than a standard taxi. Pollution however, is just one of these problems, because car crashes too are a major concern for those opposing driverless cars.\\n\\nDriverless cars aren\\'t necessarily \\'driverless\\', but for the most part, they are. Google announced a safety mechanism included in driverless cars that would \"announce when the driver should be prepared to take over\" (Driverless cars are coming). This safety mechanism ensures that the driverless car would not be completely rendered useless if a problem within the computer software did occur while driving. This helps prove the safety of the driver and the car through the emergency mechanism telling the driver to take manual control if a problem has occured. This also can relate to traffic laws, in case of an accident.\\n\\nA third concern of people against driverless cars is who is responsible in the case of an accident, driver or manufacturer? This question is currently unclear as development hasn\\'t reached the pinnacle thus far. In the article \\'Driverless cars are coming\\', it is stated that \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?\" (9). This quotation raises the question of who would be liable in the case of a driverless car accident. Potentially it would depend on which party was active during the time of the crash, the driver who had taken over manually, or the malfunction during the car\\'s autopilot stage. In the first case of manual control, the driver should be held responsible because they would be in control of the car. If the crash with another party was caused by a malfunction in the software, the manufacturer could be held responsible, but the driver too could be held responsible for not taking over the car during the time of the crash.\\n\\nAll in all, driverless cars are a step forward to the future of transportation, boasting both ecological and driving benefits. However, concerns outweigh the benefits of driverless cars, and it will be seen how the development equates with either benefit or concern. Regardless, driverless cars are a great step forward in technology, and they will benefit those in use of them.', 'score': '5', 'gpt_coherence_x': '4.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '7359', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '3.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",
      "{'inputs.question': 'In a school, there are clasrooms upon classrooms that are all teaching different, new, and exciting classes. When walking down a hallway, it is more than possible that the sounds of logorithmic functions could be taught to your left as Shakespeare might be being recited to your right. If you take a turn, one kid may be leaving his photography class to go take pictures for the yearbook while another may be returning from the restroom to go back to her chemistry class where she is studying saturated and unstaurated solutions. Despite the intense differences and varities of classes that there are at a high school, not every one of them is \"new\", \"different\", and \"exciting,\" as used previously to describe the classrooms scenes to all kids. Therefore, if it were at all possible that these kids could feel and want to be more engaged in their classes that take up a large portion of their week and youth, the way to do so should be evident in the classrooms. With this in mind, the idea that using Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms would be valuable is not only true, but something that should be acted upon. (D\\'Alto).\\n\\nIn the life of someone that is attending school, there is one idea that is always looming over their shoulder. Whether it be like a cloud on a rainy day or a shadow following them on a sunny one, grades are always an important factor in a school-goer\\'s life. Therefore, if this porgram would be able to help kids to be more interested in a topic and be more involved, they may just have improved grades from this system. In the text, the excerpt, \"\\'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored,\\' Dr. Huang predicts,\" shows that student\\'s attention could be analyazed. (D\\'Alto, 6). With this being done, if the computer would be able to recgonize confusion, the student could then be introduced to a better way to learn the material or a way that they beter understand it, then leading to better grades. (D\\'Alto, 6). Also, the grades of the students could improve based on what the computer decides to do with as much human touch as it can. The passage, \"\\'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,\\'\" shows that there is a solution to any problems a kid may have with what they are learning. (D\\'Alto 6). The fact that the computer attempts to try and help the students with a human touch shows that it would have the capibilties to do it\\'s best and help the students to learn better, overall improving the student\\'s grades. (D\\'Alto 6). With both of these examples in mind, it can be seen that the inclusion of this sytem into classrooms would have the capability to improve both a student\\'s grades and understanding.\\n\\nWhen a kid is sitting in a classroom for an hour, atleast, every day to every other day, there is seemable reason as to why and how a kid could get easily side tracked and/or bored. Despite this being true, the inclusion of this program into student\\'s lives may have the ability to greatly improve student\\'s engagement and interest in the classroom. In this article, the author includes, \"\\'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional connection,\\' notes Dr. Huang. \\'So computers need to understand that, too,\\'\" shows just how the students may become more engaged and interested in their classes that take up so much of their week days. (D\\'Alto 6). If the computers would be able to connect with the students, there is no reason that these kids would not feel more obligatred to pay attention and more interested to learn what is being taught. (D\\'Alto 6). Another reason that these kids would gain more by having this system in their schools is the idea that would engage them in a fun manner. When the author included, \"The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can really do,\" the reason is stated so in the text. (D\\'Alto 6). By including this piece, the author is showing that there, overall, is a fun factor to this could intrigue the students and keep them interested in their assignments and school overall. With these two ideas in mind, it can be seen that, as the attention of students is a primary need for schools, if this could improve just that, there is no reason not to include it in student\\'s lives.\\n\\nAs science is an ever-budding field by it\\'s own nature, there is no reason that a new technology wouldn\\'t thrive among those interested in both science and technology. Therefore, as this is something that is new and up and coming, the addition of this to clasrooms may spark a pasion for this subject and inspire a career to form. In the excerpt, \"The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanvced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam,\" shows just how recent this technology is. (D\\'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it\\'s place at school. (D\\'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,\" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D\\'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it\\'s capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D\\'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it\\'s own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.\\n\\nAs kids are ever-subject to new and upcoming ideas, it is evident that the addition of recent techology could aid their progression in school and would be deemed as important and valuable to include. If a kid were someone that easily lost interest in a course or was not very interested in a certain class, they may then be more provoked to learn and pay attention if this new technology was included at their school and interested them. By doing so, there is potential that the student would then be able to improve their grade and get much out of this porgram. Also, if a student were to be even intrigued in this technology, there could be potential for this studen to go into a job field that dealt with this type of technology as there are many that vary greatly in doing so. Overall, the inclusion of present innovations and technology should be including the next generations, as success for them now will lead to future success for all.', 'score': '6', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '7369', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

In my opinion, I think driverless cars are more dangerous than driving a car normally. A problem can occur when the driverless car is driving.

Someone will get injured, and it is not worth it.\\n\\nDriverless cars are not completely driverless.

      "{'inputs.question': \"We currently live in a world dependent on machines; becoming more and more enveloped in this idea of reliance. However, now we have reached a point where that reliance is harming us and our planet, and it will continue to do so if we don't adjust our lifestyles. Seeing as that we've recently reached that point of realization, we are starting to limit ourselves to the things that do harm our planet, including limiting the usage of cars. Living in the twentieth century almost inevitably means relying on cars for transportation. Although it may seem impossible to convince so many to pursue this act of limiting the usage of cars, it is surely not impossible, as we've seen from the recent efforts made around the world. It will take time to adjust to the drastic change, but the benefits are worth the while. A few of the many advantages include, the conservation of our valuable space, improving the quality of our environment, and allowing for the opportunity of new ideas, developments, and change.\\n\\nThe first of the advantages may not be the first you would think of, yet it is certainly an important one. By limiting our use of cars it would save and replenish our amount of space that we currently have available. It's not only the cars themselves that take up space, but it is also the space left for street parking in the big cities, the massive parking garages used at shopping malls, and the driveways and garages at the houses in large suburban neighborhoods. This method of limiting the use of cars as been successfully applied to a town in Germany, known as Vauban. In Vauban, '' [r]esidents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars '' ( '' In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' ). The town of Vauban, has given up their areas of street parking, driveways, and home garages to limit--almost entirely--their use of cars. With the removal of all traces of automobile usage, some may be concerned about how they are expected to reach their desired destinations, but in Vauban and many other places preparing the follow this plan, stores will be placed '' a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway '' ('' In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' ). Although some may be concerned with the potential limit on their car usage, they must be reminded that the space originally used for cars will certainly not go to waste, and will be used for bigger and better purposes that will not harm our planet.\\n\\nThis second advantage is the one most associated with the limit put on our use of cars--the improved quality of the environment. The environment can be improved with the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn improves the quality of the air that surrounds us. Our President, Barack Obama, has '' ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions '' ( '' The End of Car Culture '' ), but that can only be done with the cooperation of the citizens. Fortunately, that cooperation has been seen with the '' fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior '', in which '' recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by '' ( '' The End of Car Culture '' ). It is understood by professionals, that if the pattern continues, '' it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions '' ( '' The End of Car Culture '' ). Although some may be reluctant to pursue the path of limiting their use of cars, they should be well informed that by doing so, they are improvong their overall state of living by not producing these harmful properties that are being released into the air that we breathe.\\n\\nThis last advantage is most likely the most considerably accepted by the public, because of its simplicity on their part and the benefits they recieve from it. With the limit put on the use of cars, that allows for the opportunity of new ideas, developments, and change. The idea of limiting the use of cars has gone global, from Germany to Colombia to France, this idea is quickly becoming one widely accepted by the public and their officials. The idea of a car-free dat has sprouted from Colombia, in which the citizens of Colombia are encouraged tohike, bike, skate, or take the bus to work rather than using cars for transportation ( '' Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota '' ). The public has responded positively to these recent changes, saying, '' ' It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution ' '', which was spoken by '' Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife '' ( '' Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota '' ). Not only have new opportunities for the public been introduced, but so have new developments. The new developmets include '' [p]arks and sports centers...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts '' ( '' Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota '' ). The citizens of various cities can also expect to see plans in which '' ' pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected networl to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety ' '' ( '' The End of Car Culture '' ).\\n\\nThere have been many advantages associated with a limit put on the use of cars, including the conservation of our valuable space, the lowering of the greenhouse gas emissions, and the opportunity for new ideas, developments, and change. All of these advantages can be fulfilled to their entire purposes, but it is a group effort as a planet. We can continue to live in the luxury of these advantages, as long as we do our part to limit our use of cars.    \", 'score': '5', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '7406', 'gpt_coherence_y': '5.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

The basis for a plethora of T.V. shows and movies has been based on these very ideas. What if one idea of this imagined future was closer than thought possible? Driverless cars are no longer an idea for the future. Driverless cars have become an idea of the present. In paragraph 2, it states that since 2009, Google has had cars developed that can drive themselves under certain conditions. Driverless cars may face some difficulties, but the pros do outway the cons. I believe that driverless cars should be made because they allow safe multitasking for the driver, give safer conditions while driving, and set the bar higher for future technological goals.\\n\\nThe cars deemed as the future allow endless possiblities for productiveness with the driver. The self driving cars let the driver catch up on paperwork, or let them make an important call. The cars could also just be nice for a relaxation time. This wouldn\\'t be considered a safety hazard because manufacturers working on this driverless car are involving notifications for when the driver is needed. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager, states how they would deal with difficulties involving this in paragraph 8. BMW is working on making driving interesting, so that the driver wouldn\\'t just get bored as the car drives itself. Some manufacturers are working on bringing in display boards or some type of information system to make it interesting. But when the driver is needed in tough conditions, the displays are turned off and the driver is notified when needed. Every concern is listed with a solution in paragraph 8.\\n\\nThe car overall becomes safer, rather than just the action of multitasking. With regular cars, the driver has to keep eye for danger themselves. With the driverless car, it is involved that the car informs the driver when they are needed or if a rough situation is ahead. The driver would be notified by some type of sensor. The sensors have been around since as early as the 1980s, as stated by paragraph 5. The sensors in the car can cause brakes to be applied and can reduce power from the engine. The car would have a greater response and greater control than a human driver ever could. Paragraph 5 tells about the sensors and tells about how improvements for sensors are still underway to this day. In paragraph 7, it states that a driver can take control also, and will be needed in tough situations. Drivers can still have a sense of control over their car.\\n\\nDriverless cars also inspire others to shoot for high goals in the technological field. Every technological advance has been inspired by some other tehcnological discovery. Just recently, a new fad had come along called hover boards. But these hover boards weren\\'t the ones seen in the Back to the Future franchise, these hoverboards were inspired by them, but didn\\'t exactly hover. Still, the creators of this type of hover board were inspired from a different technological idea. Great strides in technology or ideas for technology make us want to move further. In paragraph 6, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of the Google car project, stated, \"There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren\\'t there, the computers weren\\'t there, and the mapping wasn\\'t there. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn\\'t something you could buy at Radio Shack.\" His basic idea, was that as time went on and technology got intensely better, so did the technological ideas. These self driving cars could inspire even more magnificent ideas for the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, these cars not only let the driver mutlitask safely, they just in general make driving safer. These cars could inspire the greatest invention in history. Technology is based off of other technology. The pros for self driving cars outway the cons for a plethora of reasons. Driverless cars are closer than one thinks, and are safer than one thinks.

      "{'inputs.question': 'In this article, the author presents us with facts about what makes Venus dangerous, and why we should try to study it despite the danger that comes with it. He provides many examples of the harsh conditions of Venus, but is lacking when it comes to reasons why we should continue to study it. Safety is the number one priority in all scientific research, and I don\\'t think this author provides enough reasons why studying Venus is worth the risk. Furthermore, when he does provide his reasons they are quickly proved wrong by himself in later paragraphs, which lowers his point immensly.\\n\\nThe author writes a lot about the challenges of going to Venus, and what makes Venus so dangerous. Yet, he barely provides any information on why it is important to go there. In paragraph 3 he writes, \"...such an environment would crush even a submarine accustumed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\" He also writes about the extreme temperatures, 97% CO2 atmosphere, sulfuric acid clouds, and things like erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. All of these challenges and dangers in one paragraph, and not even one reason why we should face these challenges and go there. In the next paragraph he says, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" He also go on to provide more information about how similar Venus is to our own planet, but still, no good reasons why we should spend money researching this planet. When you are talking about visiting a planet as dangerous as Venus, you need a lot of good reasons to go there. However, this author is lacking in his reasons, which makes him sound unprofessional.\\n\\nWithout providing a lot of research, it is hard to agree with what the author is saying. He does not do a great job of proving his point that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In paragraph 5 he writes, \"NASA\\'s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusion landscape.\" At first, this seems like a viable solution to the dangers of Venus, and sounds like a good way to safely research the planet more closely. However, it\\'s quickly shot down and is identified as a less than desireable solution in the next paragraph by the author himself. He states facts about how we wouldn\\'t be able to capture photographs from this distance through Venus\\'s thick atmosphere. He also points out that we would not be able to retreive samples of rock, gas, or anything else from this distance. This is the only good possible solution to the dangers of Venus that the author has presented thus far, and he debunks the idea almost entirely in the very next paragraph. This is a terrible way to convince the readers of his opinion; that, despite the risks Venus presents, it is a worthy pursuit to study it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the author presents more ideas that go against his point, than ideas that acually support it. He does a terrible job of supporting his ideas, and when he has a good point, he quickly proves to us himself that it is not a good idea at all. Taking all of these things into account, we can conclude that the author does a very poor job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

If you ever get the chance to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program, I suggest that you do.\\n\\nSeagoing Cowboys lets you stay with animals when you ride in the boat. When I was working, I got to work with animals such as horses and cattle. There are many animals to work with. There are also many things that you must do for the animals. You must feed them, water them, and clean out their stalls. The animals usually eat oats or wheat. Animals can be hard work, but they can also give you something fun to do.\\n\\nSeagoing Cowboys program is all by sea. You pick up the animals on land and then, you set sail and hit the water. If you have never ridden in a boat, then I suggest that you take this oppertunity in life. Boats can be very fun. They rock back and forth like a rocking chair and float on water. Boats are proably the most important thing that we need for the journey.

On the trips I have taken, I have gotten to see the Acropolis, parts of China, and have done and seen many other things. One of my favorites was riding in a gondola, in the city of water, Venice. The landmarks are important because they remind us of friendship. For example, France gave us the Effiel Tower to us as a peace treaty? Well, now you know.\\n\\nThe Seagoing Cowboy program lets you be with animals, get to ride on a boat, and gives you the oppertunity to see national landmarks like the Great Wall of China.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I\\'m almost positive if you were to look everyone woukd have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you\\'re hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn\\'t have feelings! But logically you\\'re hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and lazyness. These are the things we should focus on when we\\'re in our cars or when we talk about saftey because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce alot of problems we have, and stress.\\n\\nTo kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amout of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you\\'re breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don\\'t just dissapear! We\\'re breating it! sure you might say \"So if im breathing it doesn\\'t that mean i should be dead?!\" no.. that\\'s not the case.. Yes it\\'s bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there\\'s a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it\\'s called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it\\'s really bad for you. You may think why don\\'t we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you\\'d imagine because of all the people. Well you\\'re right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It\\'s very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it.\\n\\nMoving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say \"We can also just stop teens from driving..\" well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amout of accidents. There wouldn\\'t be asmuch cars and it will be alot safer for people to drive. Sadly in alot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 3-4 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amout of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amout of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more.\\n\\nWe\\'re almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You\\'re just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don\\'t get tired as much and it\\'s a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you\\'re in a hurry but seriously.. If you\\'re 10-20 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don\\'t only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn\\'t our only source of transportation! It\\'s not just hurting you! Don\\'t forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don\\'t see when they\\'re driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i\\'ve mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don\\'t just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away.\\n\\nTo conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce alot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and lazyness. These things just don\\'t effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world. Hopefully you read this and learned alot about the importance of limiting the usage of cars and how it can effect everything.

      "{'inputs.question': \"I feel that keeping the Electoral College is the wrong way to go. That changing it to election by popular vote is a better decision. Because the people of our nation should be able to choose who they want to be the president not the 538 electors. Why not have the whole nation vote for who they want and who ever has the majority of the votes win? That sounds like a fair election to me! The electoral college has so many faults, that just one little tiny mishap can cause a huge disater within the election.\\n\\nThe electoral college does have some advantages. Like swing states, or avoiding run-off elections . But it also has disadvantages for example it takes so many risks, its unfair to voters, its outdated, and irrational.\\n\\nThe electoral college cheats the people who are voting. I mean they didn't sign up or vote for the electors\\n\\nNO, they did it for the president. So why not give them that chance? It makes it easier on other people and the election is a fair one.\\n\\nThe picking and choosing of the electors is unorganized. Each year its a different person.\\n\\nSometimes state conventions, sometimes the states party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves.\\n\\nVoters that go and vote for which ever president they want, really aren't even voting for the president their voting for that president's elector. Which is someone who goes and votes for that president that picked them as their elector. And sometimes the voter that is actually voting for the elector to vote for their assigned president will end up voting for a different president. Also voters will sometimes get confused about all these electors and vote for the wrong candidate.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, changing from Electoral College would be the best choice to make. Because election by popular vote for the president isn't so complicated, is more reliable, isn't so risky, and most importantly the voters get a fair election.       \\xa0 \\xa0        \\xa0

As car dealerships made better looking, faster, high performance cars, the more people wanted them. After World War II when cars became inexpensive, more and more people had them. But it's also becoming an issue. Recently, that trend is going down.\\n\\nTo begin, the car industry has been at an all time high. We're making cars so fuel efficient, it almost seems impossible. We even have hybrid cars, which run on electric and fuel (respectively). But with all of the cars out there, especially in the US, the pollution in nations and our own cities are at an all time high. China's air pollution is the worst in the world. Nations have been taking the initiative to partially ban car use for a few days. Paris for instance, banned motorists with even-numbered license plates from using their vehicles, switching to odd-numbered the following day.\\n\\nFurthermore, we have Bogota, Colombia who took a different approach to the rising air pollution. Instead of what Paris did, they banned automobile use in general, for one day. Buses and taxis still ran, but private vehicles did not. This seeminly little feat over time has done wonders on the city. More and more cities, including nations, are beginning this practice.\\n\\nTo sum things up, we see that there are advantages (and of course disadvantages) to limiting car use.

Driverless cars have several issues including cyber attack and cost. It is also important for young adults to learn the responsibility of driving and it\\'s benefits. I would also like to point out that the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" is incorrect on the notion that gas usage will be reduced\\n\\nFirst, any competent hacker would be able to easily rewrite the cars programs and commit mass murder. These cars could be hacked for assassinations or just acts of terrorism. These cars would also be under attack from computer virus almost all the time, this would require a costly antivirus software for almost everycar. Driverless cars could easily become weapons against the innocent citizens during a war and are unsafe to mass produce\\n\\nThe article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" states that gas usage would drop dramatically but currently Bill Gates and several other of the worlds richest people are funding billions of dollars to find a relevant source of renewable energy. Synthetic photosynthesis is being developed, this source of energy allows the turning of gaseous carbon into liquid fuel similar to gasoline. With these predicted advancements fuel will no longer be an issue thus can\\'t be a valid argument in an article predicting advancements in the future.\\n\\nAnother reason driverless cars should not be developed is that there is a certain level of responsibility required to drive a car. This responsibilty helps mature young adults and also gives them a sense of accomplishment.

All the major roads would have to be fit with sensors and other technology to keep the cars on the road. All the major companies in the world together could not purchase these advancements.

These are just shadows. Only afew Scientists thought that the Face was an Alien artifact.\\n\\nSecondly, they took pictures and said that the face was just a landform. After they first saw the face, they wanted to take pictures as soon as possible. NASA flew the Mars Global Surveyor over Cydonia.

Who came up with all these weird names for facial expressions and facial muscles, my goodness I thought I was surely going to get taken out of class from laughing so hard at these weird names.\\n\\nI think that using technology to read someone emotions is horrible stupid. I mean come on why invade someones privacy. Why trust a computer when it can mulfunction, and calculate wrong. Yet some might say its a good thing to invade others personal emotions by using technology to see what their feeling and figure out why their feeling that way. Not everyones facial tissue or muscles are the same nor can you predict what their facial expressions mean as of emotions. Using a 3-D computer model of someones facial structer you can see the muscles of the face in different forms and can tell what emotions are showing.\\n\\nExample: Your orbivularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show your anger. So the people who agree with using this technology would rely on the 3-D facial model of someone and look for muscle tightening or high raises of the eyebrows, or tightening of the jaw.\\n\\nPeople who do not agree on this would say you can not always believe what technology says. Maybe someones facial expressions are natural. For instence someone who was born with difunctional issues; a lip attacthed to their nose, if someone were to use a picture of someone with a lip disorder and the persons lips are tight they assume it is cause they are mad. When in reality they might just be sad because their lip is stuck like that, and your assuming it\\'s tight cause their mad.\\n\\nParagraph 5 talks about humans calculating everyday. well for one when the author says, \\' You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.\" What makes you think it\\'s a she it could be a he or a she. Don\\'t assume genders author. Simply some people have trouble showing the right emotions too. For instance you could be happy and have a frown on your face and if someone were to send it the the facial computer and ask what is she/his emotions right now. Well the computer would say they are confused, when really they are happy and just had their face rested in a frown.\\n\\nIn paragraph 6 it says that, \" most human communcication is nonverbal, including emotional comunication. So computers need to understand that, too.\" Dr. Huang notes said.\\n\\nSo why do computers need to understand how we feel? If we want someone to know how we feel, we will let them know. What\\'s the point in wasting time working on a computer to figure out how someone feels when you could simply ask and not waste money and time on a computer that could malfunction? The author say\\'s that the Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows you just how much the computer can do. Well it surely didn\\'t bring a smile to my face.\\n\\nInstead it made me think of lot\\'s of questions on stuff like; what happens if your so called computer malfunctions? Where will everything go? Surely you have everything saved? Have you tested it on many people more than 20? Were those people all the same? Or were they different? Do you know what people will think of it, or how they will react to all this new technology? Why did you use technology? What happens when we go into a blackout and you can\\'t rely on any of the technology? People will want answers and then turn on you cause you relyed on something that can\\'t function without electricity.\\n\\nParagraph 7 explains some \"encoding\" emotions and what to do while looking in the mirror then the author says that those instructions are for a face that looks happy. Now if your smart and I shall hope you are, we both know if you go to a mirror and force your eyes to squint and force your lips to move upwards, and then raise your cheeks up. Lets just say that will not look like a happy face, it will look like someone who doesn\\'t know how to smile and is trying ot force a fake smile that looks horrible wrong.\\n\\nParagraph 8 talks about how a muscle clue can tell when a politician or celebrity isn\\'t being truthful. Well what if someone asks them a personal question and they don\\'t want the whole world to know? And you go and use that computer on their 3-D face you made and tell the world they were lying to that question. Hm well you just ruined that for them and exposed them. Now I know what your thinking they wouldn\\'t do that, and maybe your right or wrong. Their is always someone who can hack or get the full version of this what do you call it FACS, and that person would probably spill it to the world and thank you for creating that machine. Then you\\'re sucked into the law suits and drama and people who would sew you for ruining the world or someones life.\\n\\nIn paragraph 9 the author says, \" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.\" Does it really? I mean you can\\'t force a smile, and we all know faking a smile does not make you happy. These facts are from someone who probably just used a couple peoples facial expressions to get to publish his or her\\'s book so why not ask more than a couple peoples opinions and what they say about all this.\\n\\nI understand why you would want to read a studens emotional expressions during class to see how they feel and what you could do to make it better, but what if it doesn\\'t get better and you try everything you can and their still sitting in calss bored and tired and not giving a rat?

      "{'inputs.question': 'Cars have been the main focus of developement for many years now. Engineers attempt to create sufficient cars every time a new model is planned. Many citizens of the United States are slightly aware of the environmental damage that is caused by the cars, yet still do no think twice when it comes to driving anywhere. Many countries around the world have set fines and laws against using cars and have seemed to produce a positive outcome. These countries offer many different alternatives to using cars, creating a well developed society.\\n\\nWhile cars are a huge advantage to modern day society, they take a big toll on our environment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the\\n\\nNew York Times\\n\\nCompany, cars are the \"second largest source of America\\'s emission\" proving how much we rely on cars (source 4 paragraph 34).She also writes about numbers terrifying to the future generations. United States is responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes while Europe is only responsible for 12(source 1 paragraph 5). 50 percent is proof that Americans are too reliable on transportation sources like streets, main roads, and highways. Paris was able to clear the air from pollution. According to Robert Duffer from the\\n\\nChicago Tribune ,after enforcing a driving ban, the air cleared after an almost record setting pollution fog (source 2 paragraph 10). Places in Asia like Beijing, China are just filled with smog in the air. The citizens walk around with masks because of the heavy pollution. That is physically dangerous for not only the adults, but the children of the communities. There has to be some alternatives to using cars in excess. Almost anything can be an advantage but when it is used too much, it will always be dangerous.\\n\\nEven though cars are important to commerce within society, many alternatives can be taken to help lower the usage of cars. In places like the capital of Columbia, they have found a way to travel places and limit the car use. Andrew Selsky, from the\\n\\nSeattle Times , speaks of this matter. He claims that there has been \"construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths\" in the city of Bogota (source 3 paragraph 27). Not only does this allow the citizens to be environmentally friendly, but it gives them a chance to exercise, which leads to better health. It is noticable the the healthier people tend to be more lifting than the sluggish, corpulent citizens. In Barcelona, Spain, being a vehicle owner is simple undesired. Other means of transportation like walking or bycycling have been the desired means of getting places. Even Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor Company, admits to the impractical use of cars in excess. There are some many different ways the we can reduce the use of Cars in the American nation.\\n\\nWith the ability of using bikes to arrive at destinations, many places have seen the improvements in reduced traffic jams. What Americans hate the most are traffic jams. Think about those times when 10 minutes have slipped away in the morning and you are running late then there is a traffic jam. Millions in Columbia participated in hiking or biking and it left the street nearly empty (source 3 paragraph 20). The citizens were smart enough to recognize when they need a car. When going to work that is only 5 miles away, they take the extra time to reduce the usage of the streets. France experienced the same result, reducing traffic congestion by 60 percent, and then lowering the smog that had covered them (source 2 paragraph 14). This leaves the street safer for drivers and pedestrians. It also reduces the heavy noise from motored vehicles.\\n\\nMany nations have improved their societies by reducing the use of cars. In result, the air pollution is reduced, the health benefits improve, and the traffic congestion is heavily reduced. Not only can reducing our relience on cars benefit our genertaion, but it can benefit the generations to come.

Carbon emissions are gases that are released into the atmosphere by transportation and other types of industrial manufacturing. Lately, there has been a change evolving in different areas as supported by each source, that is moving toward \"[car- free cities]\". However, most citizens are also wondering what are the advantages of limiting their car usage, and how will it effect the life around their community; There have been ways of doing this as stated in these sources.\\n\\nIn source 1:\\n\\nIn German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it explains how in \"Vauban, Germany, the residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few...

As it seems economically and environmentally effiecient, people such as Heidrum Walter feel \"when I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" (paragraph 3). The people in this area have noticed that \" all of [their] development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change, said by David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States...\" (paragraph 7).\\n\\nComporable to source 1, source 2:\\n\\nParis bans driving due to smog , by Robert Duffer, states that \"after days of near- record pollution, Paris [had] enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\" (paragraph 10). People were \"ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22- euro fine ($31), (paragraph 11), and \"[a]lmost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters- an international news agency headquartered in London\" (paragraph 12). Most believed that it was a rivalry between Paris, France and \"Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\" (paragraph 14).\\n\\nBecause of the tremendous fog, \"[d]elivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug- in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying [several] passengers. Also, [p]ublic transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC (paragrpah 18).\\n\\nSource 3:\\n\\nCar- free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , by Andrew Selsky, states that in Bogota, Colombia \"a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombials hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car- free day...\" (paragraph 20).\\n\\nThey participated in this special occasion consecutively for three years, banning cars, but allowing taxi cabs, and buses for the \"Day Without Cars\" in the captial city; This promoted other transportation methods, while reducing smog output.

Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said, \"[i]t\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, as he rode a two- seat bicycle with his wife\" (paragraph 24). \"[This] day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid- 1990s\" (paragraph 27). \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city...\" (paragraph 28).\\n\\nSource 4:\\n\\nThe End of Car Culture , (another article) by Elisabeth Rosenthal, provides more information towards this evolving movement nationwide. Not only is change occuring in the previous countries described, but the United States has started to be part of the change. \"... [G]oals to curb the United States\\' greenhouse gas emissions..., will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior...\" (paragraph 29).\\n\\nNumerous researchers are contemplating \"a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?\" (paragraph 30). Over the years the United States of America has gained notoriety for \"its broad expanses and suburban ideals, [which has] long been one of the world\\'s prime car cultures. Over the years, there has been an assembly line in Detroit, Michigan during the \\'40s- \\'60s and the \"Model T\" gave Americans the way to take a spin in \"Mustang Sally\" during the \"Midnight Hour\", while listening to Wilson Pickett (paragraph 31).\\n\\nOverall, most countries including America, have seen changes in their economy.

Rosenthal states that there was a recession, and that the unemployed weren\\'t working, but regardless, the people that were working still couldn\\'t dodge the recession, which ultimately impacted not only the Automotive Industry, but everything else. Car companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranded their businesses (around the world, as it is Ford is an American car and Mercedes is a German car) (paragraph 32).\\n\\n\"Many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants\" (paragraph 34).

Since it has a lot in common with Earth it is good to have a litle insight on this planet. In the article it says that\" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sich as valleys, moutains, and craters\" this shows how much Earth and venus have incommon. This also gives us an opertunity to take a planetary visit to Venus in the future. Despite the dangers it could cause on someone.\\n\\nNext, in the reading it says that Venus has\" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxid blankets\" This is one example of how dangerous Venus is. In the article is says\" Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun\" This is another example of how dangers Venus is. However going to Venus is not a bad idea beacuse life form could have been there in the past. People believe life forms could have existed beacuse of the examples like caters, moutains, and valleys. Despite Venus being the hottest planet in our solar system.\\n\\nThen, on that note Venus is not the cloestet planet to the sun but has the highest tempature than all of your planet\\'s in the solar system. However studying Venus can give us insight on what to make to prevent for somone or something burning on its surface. While we have been studying Venus all we have seen is a look from a ship orbiting above the planet, that gives us little intel on it surface. We get little intil from that beaucse \" most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere\". However if scientists seeking to conduct Venus will have to get closer to the planet.\\n\\nLastly, in the reading it says\" Venus, sometimes called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky\" but not all people know that Venus is not a star it is a planet. However to a amateur stargazer it may just look like another star. Venus is called Earths twin beaucse of how alike they are in distance. Some scientist think this is intersting and want to look into this planet despite the dangers of it. Some scientist have looked into Venus but only have sent unmanned trips.

Our world today mostly depends on computers and machines to do most of everything. Many inventors and scientist have discovered so many technological things and as the years progress, we get smarter and smarter and come up with more discoveries. Since we depend so much on technology, its a norm to use it, so mostly everything scientist, inventors and doctors come up with is valuable or useful.\\n\\nDr. Paul Eckman, the creator of this new technology the Facial Action Coding System, has worked with many other scientist and doctors to create this technology, that enables computers to identify human emotions. This is a very valuable technology that our world needs today. There are plus and down sides to this argument of the technology being valuable or not. It is valuable because it can be use for many things throughout the world, for example paragraph 6 states, \"A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" This technology would help the teacher see what he or she needs to do to be able to make the class more exciting to make students learn and pay attention more. Paragraph 8 states, \" To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful.\" The technology would be valuable in a situation like an important election, where if a person running for something is lying about something, you would be able to tell using the help of the FACS.\\n\\nIn conclusion there are many reasons why we should or should not use the Facial Acting Coding System. We depend on technology most of the time, so this would be just another cool addition to our collection of discoveries we already have. Knowing the exact emotion of your mom, dad or friend from a computer software, would be very useful to see if there telling the truth or not.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Driverless cars are coming may be good or bad. The passage support mutliple good and bad reasons. I myself am against driveless cars. The passage indicates that, \" Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves.\"(Driverless, 10). Many cars are being taken in to be a driverless car as you can in the sentence quoted above from the passage.\\n\\nEven though driverless cars may become popular I am against this because stated in the passage. \" The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph.\" From my own point of view the car can maybe lose control. ( Driverless, 7) People who accept these cars has to realise that the car can be harmful in many ways. \" These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\" ( Driverless, 3) The sentence before states it may require huge upgrade to roads. If the roads take to fix that means the other regular car drivers cars may get damaged. The cars may get damaged because it is a massive road ,for cars that are driverless.\\n\\nThe passage may state a good reason such as, \" something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In the way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big dream.\" (Driverless, 8) But what if you are texting and the car alerts you that it needs human access and you are so concentrated on your phone you do not pay attention. Therefore the car keeps using the non-human program and it would be a possibility you may wreck something or someone.\\n\\nMost driving laws concentrate on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe at all times. I agree with this quote from the passage, \" traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only car has a human driver in control at all times.\" (Law, 9) In some states it is , \"illegal even to test computer-driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the contry in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars.\" (Law, 9)\\n\\nAntilock brakes an ddriver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless cab to take you wherever you would like to go. So they are not as driverless as you think. In the passage stated , \" The sensors weren\\'t there, the computers weren\\'t there, and the mapping wasn\\'t there. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn\\'t something you could just buy at Radio Shack.\" \" So just how driverless will the cars be in the near future?\" (Assisting, 6) Now as you can see and read over the cars are not all that driverless but the cars are a very high price. The cars are not worth it.\\n\\nI supported against because I felt cars should always be human controlled. Just in case of an accident you may can save your life if you are focus on the road. These were good and negative resons stated throughtout but citizens have to realise that would hurt the some profits because the cars are so high in price that no one will buy the product and some car places will lose businesses.

There are many arguments on the subject of having this new idea or not. Some believe it would be a great addition for the future and others think they should not be invented. In my own opinion i believe that the driverless cars should not be a thing for the future. And there are many reason to why i think that.\\n\\nAlthough it is known that many people in america are wanting driverless cars im not so sure that it is the best thing we need. There are some advantages to this like how they may be safer when it comes to the new features they are including. But the dissadvantages by far overcome them. For one, driverless cars are less work and basiclly for the most part you just have to watch the road unless you would like to take control, however, that is a huge problem in this day in age because, everyone is creating new things so everyday jobs arent as hard for people to do but that is just adding to the lazyness of americans. Its one thing to create things like a stove so you dont have to create a fire just to heat your food but to go all the way to not even having to drive your car thats a little to much. This problem is just like the idea of elevators so you dont have to walk up and down stairs thats just a creation made out of pure lazyness. So i think driverless cars are really pushing it when it comes to inventions for the people that make us the lazyest country.\\n\\nThe driverless cars may seem to be more safe although think about even the most high tech items you know of even those get messed up and malfuction sometimes right? So there isnt any doubt in my mind that the car wouldnt either. So if you were to be in the car and say it was supposed tos stop at a red light but it got messed up and it didnt stop it could cause a crash and that could do some real damage to you and the others in the crash. And who would they blame was at fault? would you get the blame or would the car? Its hard to trust internet programed things especialy when it may come to your life. If a person was driving they would know to stop at a red light. But with the driverless cars those are just computers that can mess up at anytime.\\n\\nIt might be dfficult to see eye to eye because now days our natural instinct is to go for the thing that makes your life easier. But we all need to see that even though it may be easier and less work it is also a accendent waiting to happen. Although the new car has safty percautions and you can take control of it doesnt make it perfectly safe and it doesnt make it a good idea. And it might use less gas making you able to save you money but that also means the owners to the gas are lossing there money it all works like a chain reaction.\\n\\nMaking the right decision is important for us to do because of our future generation. Think about how this would be a bad effect on our life and society. in my general opinion the phrase \"driverless cars are coming\" should not come into affect becuase of the dissadvantages and the bad effects and the pure lazyness that would be put into the idea of the car.

Today they are trying to invent cars that drive themselves but still require a driver. However I don\\'t feel like driverless cars are necessary in today\\'s world. There is too much room for error, just like any piece of technology, there\\'s errors, and things can break. Talking about driverless cars means to trust your life with some piece of technology. I want to be confident when I\\'m drivng, meaning, I\\'m in full control of what I\\'m doing. I don\\'t want to have to blame anyone else but my self if I cause an accident.\\n\\nThe first acouple statements of the passage states \" Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore? He envisions a future with a public- transport system where fleets of driverless cars form a public- tansport taxi system.\" I can\\'t imagine a time like that because there a millions of people out there who are able to drive perfectly by themselves. I don\\'t think that people want to have to rely on calling a driverless car to come pick them up to take them to work or go to other places. People like to be self sufficient, get up and go whenever they want to. People don\\'t want anything holding them back or preventing them of what they want to do.\\n\\nThe passage also states \"Most laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and law makers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?\" If they continue to go on with the idea of driverless cars, a lot of events have to go right for them. It\\'s going to take a lot of time, to propose new driving laws and getting the technology where they want it to be. I belive if it\\'s not broke, don\\'t fix it. Also if there were to be an accident in one of these cars, the question of liability could cause a lot of problems and headaches. I question the safety of these cars and how reliable they are. I don\\'t think that many people would trust their life with a car that can drive itself.\\n\\nDriving is a privlage and a huge stepping stone in life. Driving also comes with alot of responsibility, and educates people on saftey, and help with social interaction. Driverless cars also take the fun out of driving. Most teenager boys and girls can not wait until they turn the legal age and can get behind the wheel and drive. Most teenager vison themselves driving anywhere and everywhere after they get their license. Going to driverless cars makes driving boring and doesn\\'t teach young adults the respnsibility and importance of safety while driving. Paragraph 8 states \" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn\\'t drivers get boared waiting for their turn to drive?\" It also limits what they learn, like the laws and rules of the roads while driving. Driving is neccessary in most people\\'s lives today, and a lot of people enjoy driving.\\n\\nDriverless cars sound like they can be very expensive. If Sergey Brin\\'s envision holds true, where are they going to get the money to provide cars for evryone in the world who needs them?\\n\\nI do not support driverless cars because there is too much room for error, I don\\'t want to rely on a car to pick me up and take me places. Driverless cars limit the learning potential about driving for beginner drivers. Drivng is fine the way it is now, they just need to focus their attention on the cars people drive today.\\n\\nAlthough these cars might sound like a good idea now, but could cause a lot of unneccesary chaos in the future.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, and Audi. What do these car companies have in common? Less people are intrested in them, limiting car usage in certain places has lead to the popularity and need of owning a car decrease. Which so that there are advantages to limiting car usage such as less polution and less traffic.\\n\\nTo begin, limiting car usage can lessen the amount of pollution in the air. Pollution is a topic used when hybrid cars are being talked and how they use less gas and pollute less but what about no pollution at all. How can we stop pollution? By no longer needing cars because\\n\\n\"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\"\\n\\n(Elizabeth Rosenthal paragraph 5). Fifty percent in the U.S. of greenhouse gas that is outrageous. As Americans we need to see that the greenhouse gases are causing all the global warming and animals becoming extinct because the enviroment around them is changing in ways they aren\\'t used to. Limiting greenhouse gases is a must if pollution one day is going to stop. Also, limiting car use can benefit getting rid of the amount of useless gases in our atmosphere. As humans we need oxygen to live but in our atmosphere we currnetly have less then twenty percent of oxygen. We breathe in nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. In order to get rid of one or two of these gasses we need to limit the car use because limiting car use\\n\\n\"Will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions.\"\\n\\n(Elizabeth Rosenthal paragraph 34). Cars make up so much of our gas emissions which is a huge reason to why the air is so mixed with many different gasses that our body just dosen\\'t need, and so much smog and air pollution that is heating everything up and killing our planet that we currently inhabit. Unless we have colonies on Jupiter and Mars it seems like we are only killing ourselves.\\n\\nTo continue, limiting car usage can help lower the amount of traffic on the street. When diriving people always get mad when there is traffic or if they are caught in rush hour, why not just say getting to my job is a two minute drive I should just walk. Plus traffic can cause accidents wether it\\'s someone in a hurry, or road rage, or just a complete accident, they happen. France at one point banned even number licence plate cars from driving on certain days and odd number licence plate cars on another to limit pollution, but one intresting stat from when they put the restrictions in place\\n\\n\"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France.\"\\n\\n(Robert Duffer paragraph 14). Traffic down sixty percent in such a large city which also has to help the tourist who don\\'t have to wait so long for their taxi driver to get to the Eiffel Tower. Having traffic down such a huge percentage is an enourmous thing to have in a large area like that because an accident in that city can ruin a lot of people\\'s days so limiting car usage can help in that situation. Also, every year in Cloumbia they have a day without cars to limit pollution and to encourage everyone to get out more and to walk and run around in the city of Bogota which is the city in which the day is held. Columbia limiting there use even if it\\'s once a year is great where\\n\\n\"Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.\"\\n\\n(Andrew Selsky paragrah 28). Limiting car use for one day a year even helps for one day of traffic where rush hours have very little traffic where the only people on the road are the people who don\\'t want to follow the day with no cars. Having the little bit of traffic extremely helps tourist and people who have to use cabs to get around the city to go to work.\\n\\nTo conclude, major car companies like BMW and Jaguar need to watch out because not only is the popularity in cars not as high anymore, the need for them might be just as low because of countries stepping in and limiting car use to help lower the amount of pollution and traffic as they are helping to make the world a better place.

      "{'inputs.question': \"I am for the development of driver-less cars. Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves. Google has made cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Having driver-less cars in the near future would make it a lot easier on adult drivers. The drivers would still have to be alert, but the cars would alert them at any time there is danger or at any time the drivers need to be extra careful. I agree with the development of having driver-less cars.\\n\\nThe new driver-less cars have sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. Automakers use speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\\n\\nThe driver-less car still needs a driver no matter what technology they bring into the automotive systems. Dr. Werener Huber says that they have to interpret the driving fun in a new way. Some manufacturers suggested that they do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. The display could be turned off when the driver needs to take over. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature and safety is a big concern when it comes to driving.\\n\\nMost driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Driver-less cars wouldn't be breaking the laws by driving them around becuase driver-less cars have to have a human driver in the car at all times incase something were to go wrong. The human driver would be able to fix the problem.\\n\\nAutomakers are continuing their work on solving all the problems that will need to be solved ahead of time before human drivers can start driving these cars. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

      "{'inputs.question': 'To the state and the state\\'s country, the election of our president must be seen carefully and wisely. As the citizens of the state, people must realize that choosing someone to take control of orders and regulations and the way the country evolves, is a process that needs to be thought of and taken fairly. The president is to serve the people of his country well with responisbilities that can vary to meet the needs of the country,but the electoral college seems to become more and more unfair to those who vote. It must be changed to meet the needs of giving a responisble president, a more trustworthy election and the votes cast must be directly towards him rather than the electors. In other words, the Electoral College must be changed to become more fair towards the citizens.\\n\\nThe United States Of America, is of course a massive country with large variations of different needs. All over, there are people who vary in opinions, beliefs and lifestyle which can cause the Election of the president to become an important subject matter. To meet the needs of so many people, instead the Electoral college must not choose a president that takes up space, but instead have a right mind to be responisble in taking charge of the country and the people.\\n\\nThere are many reasons why a responsible president must be choose. Things like creating rules to attend the needs of all citizens and create equality amongst them, to keeping harm from out of reach, the Electoral College should become much more wiser in choosing the right ruler to take control. In the article\\n\\nWhat Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled \"Certificate Of Ascertainment\" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text\\n\\nIn the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone\\'s president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.\\n\\nThe country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as \"Winner-Take -All\" due to states titled as the \"Swing States,\" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.\\n\\nThere is very little equality when it comes to elections especially, when the states are giving an unreliable system to choose for them. States that are considered \"Toss Ups\" are selfishly awarded the system named \"Winner-Takes-All\" due to how they apparently pay closer attention to the campaign. In the article\\n\\nWhat Is The Electotal College by the office of the Federal Register, the method is first introduced in paragraph 7. Stating that the purpose of the \"Winner-Take-All\" system is not only,but to award all electors to the winning canadidate. It is said to be unrelaible and untrustworthy due to it\\'s focus on states that appear t have more attention towards the election. On a more basic level, some states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina had not even witness the campaign and even leaving a few voters to have no say. Going back to the misunderstanding of the election of Romney,the country wittnessed an iresponsible canadidate that had ran for president. With the unreliable ridiculous system \"Winner-Take-All\" some states may or may not have even experienced how Romney had acted and his intentions towards the elections and the campiagn. With very little knowledge of the presidential canadidate and with limitations of voting and campaign ads, there is very little trust given towards the election process especially with more than a few states that are not being taken very seriously, with very little say. If the Electorial College could give off more information and more become more reliable towards all states, the process would be less sinister and more apreciated.\\n\\nThere are many more other factors in which the Electorial College must be changed to meet the appropriate dilemas and needs of the voters and their intentions towards the campaign. On the other hand, it has not changed at all only to stay unfair towards the entire country and possibly cause a catasrophe.\\n\\nLet us say, there have been many incidents where elections have been on the edge of a major dilema. Wondering why a straight up orderly process can go to the point of a catasrophe, can all be easily explained as unfair.\\n\\nAll can be simplified in the article\\n\\nWhy Even The Best-Laid Defesnes of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, states back to the disater factor of the election of John F.Kennedy. It states back to the 1960\\'s where faithless electors had pushed aside the votes and sayings of Louisiana had decided to vote for whomever they had wanted. It had caused a problem of course since the votes where not even of the people, but of the selfish sick minds of the electors who toke the process into their own hands. In the same paragraph it staes back to when the state of Hawaii had sent in two slates of electors to congress. With the unreliable actions of Richard Nixion,\\xa0 had validated his opponent\\'s electors of course to win over the campaign. once again another issue arises in the article\\n\\nFive Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President, it agrees with the unfairness of the electorals by giving the example of how the Electorial College had turned off the potential voters due to the knowledge that their votes will be uncared for. In paragraph 23, it states that in the state of Texas, it was known that the votes would have know effect of the campaign what so ever. It aslo had staes that voters in politcal elections have no care rather than to express the political refrence than what the peole think or decide. This sums up that the process is unfair to many of the states voters and must be changed to become more open and share the equality with those who are losing thier trust.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electorial College mut be changed to meet the need of those who agree that is it irresponisble when givng a repsonisble president, a more trustworhty election and an unfair process. Yet this can all be fixed simply by changing the ways it is run and to give more freedom for the people.

They can be dangerous by having the car drive by itself for a long period of time then need the human to take over and they could have fallen asleep. If the human would not take over then the car could crash and hurt the people inside of it. That is one reason cars should not be able to drive itself.\\n\\nAnother reason is some people enjoy driving. I like to drive and if driveless cars take over then people like me won't be able to drive their cars.

That is my other reason to not have driveless cars.\\n\\nI mean there are a few things that could be good about a driveless car, but for the most part there is more negative things than positive things on them.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Imagine being convinced that completing a certain task is worth any strugles along the way, and you end up severely hurt because of it. That is exaclty what the author of this article is trying to do. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author does a poor job of supporting the idea that studying a planet as dangerous as Venus is worth it. Studying Venus is a terrible idea because technology isn\\'t advanced enough, it would take years to discover anything beneficial, and the costs\\' of this, both in money and lives, are outrageous.\\n\\nTechnology throughout the world has improved since the 1900\\'s,however, it has improved on Earth and in regards to Earthly tasks. When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus\\'s surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can\\'t withstand Venus\\'s conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.\\n\\nExploring unmarked territory isn\\'t something that can be done over night. Unmarked territory is exactly what Venus is. Even if technology did evolve enough so that humans could visit this planet, it would takes years, decades, even centuries, to accomplish. In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs\\' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving \"what if\" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, \"Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus\". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, \"Is it worth the wait?\". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.\\n\\nAssuming that the exploration of Venus does eventually happen one day, how much money would go into it, how many lives? These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it\\'s worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, \" On the planet\\'s surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.\\n\\nIn conclusion, since our technology isn\\'t advanced enough, it would take far too many years to do, and the human and money costs wuold be outrageously high, we should not explore Venus. Exploring Venus proves to be very dangerous, and we have proved that we are no where near being ready for such a task. We would first need to advance our technology for the task. This would take years to due, it would also use up a ton of money, and put people in serious danger. The author did a terrible job of supporting the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dnagers it presents. For one, there were not enough facts presented in the article that were beneficiary to the idea. Also, of the pros that were present, the cons outweighed then tremendously. Exploring Venus proves to be a terrible idea, atleast until we are actually ready to do it.

There are too many things that could go wrong and that's if the government even lets these cars out on the road. It would be a really great idea, especially on longer trips like our family trip down to Florida every year for spring break. In reality I just can't see it being that safe and successful.\\n\\nThe writer talks a little bit about having special roads for these cars and this is just a concept of mere fiction. There is no way we can embed every single one of America's roads with an electrical cable, it's just not a possible thing to do. With America already in so much debt, I can't see how making these roads a reality would actually help the United States in any way.\\n\\nNow we are going to scratch the smart road thing because we all know that it's ridiculous, and move on to a semi-possible option-smartcars. My first topic here is that machines always malfunction eventually. No matter how well the manufacturer makes them, they will always malfunction in some way or another. I'm sure these cars will cost a fortune, and with that cost no one will want to update them every three years. Not wanting to update these cars puts everyone at risk for malfunctions. Personally I know I'm bad about taking the time to update my phone, so I'd be really bad about updating my car. Whether that be the cars data recognition is worn out or the technology simply isn't up to date, malfunctions will happen.\\n\\nWhen these malfunctions do happen, who is to blame? The car for not working properly or the person for not updating their car? Technically, it is the cars fault for not stopping and rearending another car, but a car can't pay for the damages. I could see a lot of law suits coming out from this, may it be between individuals in an accident or a customer verses a manufacturer. I think manufacturers should really do themselves a favor and say out of this technology advance. Accidents are already not fun we don't need to add another complicated measure to the process.\\n\\nWhen I first read about the driverless car I thought it was a great idea, and not until I dug a little deeper into the concept did I realize that there are some things about a driverless car that our society isn't ready for. We don't have the money to help this idea be successful, nor do we have the mindsets of Americans to make it successful. I believe within my lifetime that it could be good to have driverless cars, but for now I can only look at it as a great idea with bad reprecussions. \", 'score': '4', 'gpt_coherence_x': '2.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '8718', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '1.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '1.0'}\n",

Also NASA says that the face was only shawdos that made it look like a face and they also sent other ships with better cameras to take pictures.\\n\\nFirst is that things like this happen on Earth too.

That just makes me feel dumb then if the elector does vote for the same person asme its not really even final becuase that vote doesnt go towards the president it goes toward the state elector and its basically there choice. another con in the electoral college system is that the same fiasco in 2000 will break out again. were the legislatures are responsible for picking electors and they dont take in to concideration of other people votes. the con that could mostly impact america is a tie in the electoral vote. another reason the electoral college is an stupid way to vote is that the big states get better privelges than the smaller states they out rule the smaller states.

      "{'inputs.question': 'The presidental elections are a huge deal in the United States and everywhere else. We all sit on anticipation to see who our next leader is hoping that they will make great changed for their country and their people, eventually making it a great place to live. Not many people are well informed about this system we have here, and some are. But could you imagine if more people find out that they aren\\'t actually voting for the President but instead your are voting for the people that are voting for the President? Does that make any sense? As you very well know there are two sides to every story Senater. Many people agree with the Electorial Collage and many people don\\'t. However my personal belief is that you should not support the Electorial Collage. I believe that this system is unfair, it doesn\\'t give Americans full control over elections and who\\'s running the country as well as the fact that many people voted for the Electorial Collage may make the wrong decisions which could jepordize the election and lets not forget about the winner take all system.\\n\\nTo begin with, the first reason I don\\'t think you should support the Electorial Collage is because the system is unfair and it doesn\\'t give Americans full control over elections and their results. During Election time people are tricked into thinking that they are voting for the President. They play Presidential ad for campains and the candidates go give speeches around the country. But if your not really voting for the Presidents, then why are they wasting all this money and wasting your time having you watch the ads. Source two it says \" If you lived in Texas, for inatance, and wanted to vote for (John) Kerry, you\\'d vote for a slate of thirty-four electoral votes. Who are the electors?\" amd in source 1 it says \"THe fouding fathers established it in the Constitution as a comprimise.\" But honest is it really a comprimise is you\\'re not involved? People want to be involved in this type of stuff, believe it or not it matters to them. And because you are not really told, people could go on for years thinking that their voting for the actual President but instead they are voting for politicans and hoping that they make the right decisions. Are we really going to leave the fait of our country up to hope and up to people that don\\'t really know what their voting for. This is not fair and it doesn\\'t live up to American values.\\n\\nAnother reason that you shouldn\\'t support the Electorial Collage is because many of the politicans that people vote for make the wrong decisions and could jepordize the future of our country. Everyone makes mistakes but in presidental elections you can\\'t, it is veyr important that things are monitered closely. After all you are voting for a person who is going to run and represent your country. But many politicians feel that since they have power that they can do whatever they want. Even go as far as rigging election votes so they can win. in source two it states that \"Those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" In other words they may not listen to what the people want and instead be selfish and listen to what they want. Now of course we know this isn\\'t right. \"Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\" This isn\\'t fair to the people, because by doing that you are saying they don\\'t have a say. And people have a lot of trouble trusting politicians, would you blame them it\\'s not every day that you come across a person who wants the best for their people and puts them first instead of themselves.\\n\\nThe final reason that you shouldn\\'t approve or support the Electorial System is because of the \"Winners take all\" system. In this system candidates really don\\'t bother going or speaking or visiting the state their running in. This basically means that the people who vote for them are making a blind vote without really knowing the person. Before voting for anyone in any situation student council, Goverment, and ect. You need to know that person. You need to make sure that they share the same values that you do. You need to make sure that they are the best candidate for the state and not some random street alcoholic. People have enough trouble trusting politicans as it is why make it worse? \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all.\" This statement also includes political ads, they saw none at all. And you expect them to vote for the President of the United States without prior knowledge how is that even allowed? That is why I call it a blind vote.\\n\\nHowever even in the midst of all that wrong with Electorial System people have found right in it. For instance source 3 says that \"But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).\" Although this statement has some truth to it, it also has some false. The problem that i have with that statement is that there are no facts to back it up. Sure you believe that our trust is rarely betrayed but actually you don\\'t know. Politicans are very secrative and protected at all cost. You have no ideas what going on in their office unless they make a public announcement on it and sometimes that\\'s even a lie. We don\\'t know our politicans really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tv shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth and how much is lie? Sometimes politicans lie to protect the people from pain or ect. But you shouldn\\'t being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up some how the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President. Are you willing to take that chance?\\n\\nTo reiterate the bottom line is that these Electorial Collages are important. The people we select in our office are important. However if we let our people become involved in actual Presidental elections we are leaving the future of our country up to hope and to people who make the wrong decisions as well as the \"Winner takes all system.\" Is that really what we want for our country? People need to be involved thats why its called The United States of American. We are suppose to be united. Sure our government could be a little corrupt at times but maybe by letting people become more involved we may actually be looking forward to a brighter and better America.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Many countries and places are starting to reduce their usage of cars. In multiple places they are to considered \"car-free\" or they have ensued partial car bans, even going as far as setting a specific day to \"Car-free Day\". The issues in most of these places is the reduction of the smog that is thought to be produced by diesel vehicals. The fights against polution are really starting to take effect in a multitude of places, such as, Vauban, Germany. Paris, France and Bagota, Colombia. And their efforts against polution is really starting to take ahold and become popular.\\n\\nIn Vauban, Germany- The people of this high class community have completely given up their vehicals. In Vauban, street parking and other car related items are forbidden in the \"experimental new district\". The main thoroughfare however, is one of the few places on the edge of the city where car ownership is allowed. But, there are only ever two places to park. A large set of garages at the very edge of the development. Where said car owner would be required to but a space and a home for 40,000$. Just for a parking lot.\\n\\nResulting factors from this Car-Free suburban, people seem to be happier without their vehicals. Vauban\\'s residents seem to rather enjoy \"the swish of bicycle tires, the chatter and laugter of the wandering children, drown out the occasional distant motor.\" Vauban is to be considered a main component of a movement called \"smart planning\". When finished in 2006 57 percent of it\\'s residents sold their vehicals to move into the residence.\\n\\nGermany\\'s efforts in the past two decades have never been as successful as Vauban has been. With its 5,500 residents withing a rectangualr square mile, it is considered to be on of the most advanced experiments in low-car/carless suburban life. Germany has been attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transport. Whether it be bikes, walking, skates or some form of physical transport. Near by these carless suburbs, they place stores along a main street near the suburb and not in some mall miles away on a interstate/highway.\\n\\nEven though Germany is trying to create a utopia of carless suburbs there are still places that still thrive on the dream of large New York-ian style suburbs, private garages and spread out homes. These were the deam towns of the 1950\\'s. Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vauban-like.\\n\\nIn Paris, France- Paris enforced a partial driving ban on it\\'s residents to help clear out the choking smog, which is rival to that of Beijing, China. Paris officials ordered motorists with even-numbered license plates to keep their cars at home or they will be fined 22 euros or 31$ in American currency. The same ensued for those with odd-numbered plates the next day.\\n\\nDue to this ban and fine on automobiles, almost 4,000 people had their cars impounded due to their reactions to getting a fine. Granted in the same token street congestion was down nearly 60% in France\\'s capital. France, and Paris officials blammed diesel vehicals for their abundance of smog, although there is a tax that favors diesal gas instead of regular gasoline. So in turn to this gas tax, diesal made up 67% of all vehicals in France.\\n\\nUnfortunately due to the high percentage of diesal vehicals the Paris has more smog that any other European capital. Although this ban did have a few consiquences, delivery companies complained of lost revenue. While people with plug-in cars, hybrids, and cares carrying three or more passangers. People found that public transit was completely free of charge during the experimental period of this car ban. The smog thankfully cleared just enough that the ruling French party to rescind the car ban for odd-numbered plates a few days later.\\n\\nIn Bagota Colombia- Colombian officials set to spread a program across to ohther countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, skated, biked, and or took buses to work durring car-free day. For a period of three years Colombia has dedicated one day to car-free day, all violators would be fined 25$. In a city of 7 million. The goal is to reduce and promote alternative tranportations to and from work, school, home, and to reduce smog levels umungst the city.\\n\\nDespite the heavy rains and grey skies, the turnout was more than expeced. And for the first time, two other Colombian cities joined into the event, spreading it further than ever. Officials from other countries came to Bagota to see the car-free event and were exstatic. Claming that the people of Colombia were generating a revolutionary change, and it\\'s crossing borders.\\n\\nThis day has been a work in progress ever since the mid 1990\\'s. Bagota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. The most any Latin American city has ever seen in years past. An abundance of parks and sports centers have popped up, sidewalks that were small, worn and pitted have been completely replaced with smooth broad sidewalks and paths. Even new upscale dining and shopping districts have popped up due to this car-free day.\\n\\nGoals set by President Obama are seemingly being unveiled as time passes due to studies suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars, and all together driving less and less as time passes by. With the United States being one of the worlds largest car capitals, it seems that love for cars is dwindleing with efforts to keep down polution and smog levels.\\n\\nThe most accurate assumption today as to why the US\\'s love and total buying of cars has dwindled so drastically is due to the recession that we had experienced. Cash-stapped Americans couldnt afford to buy new vehicals and that seems to be a persistant happening as the years pass. Unfortunately major car companies are starting to suffer due to this fall of people indulging in a car purchase.\\n\\nCompanies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to \"rebrand\" themselves as mobility companies and reorganising their product with wider varieties. Not only has car buying dropped, so has the rate of people between the ages of 16-39 getting a license. Most people are turning to car-pooling, walking or public transportation to get to their jobs, or other places, so in turn, getting a license is in not in the forefront of their mind.\\n\\nMany countries are getting on the bandwaggon of fighting against polution, ensueing laws against driving all together, creating temporaty or partial bans. And they see a difference in their smog, polution levels. These people/countries are taking the innitiative to take care of the major underlying problems to much bigger problems such as global warming and problems of that nature.

Students that have the Facial Action Coding System technology avilable to them would learn faster then some of the other students in the classroom.

When the FACST (Facial Action Coding System Technology) recongizes that a student is really confused or lost. Say if it\\'s a reading assignment and the student speaks and only understands spanish and if the spanish audio is going to fast. The FACST can see a bit of confusion and worrying on the students face and it could modify the lesson to make the audio go slower so the spanish speaking student can understand what he is being read better. The FACST could also recongize if a studemt is depressed or sad and the students or parents and teachers don\\'t know about it yet it could possibly just email it to the teacher of the student amd to the parents. Saying something for example you\\'r child today wasn\\'t very focused and seemed a bit depressed you should have talk with you\\'r child.

FACS can read the students faces and tell wither they understand the lesson. It will then change the lesson to something that will help the students better understand. The FACS can also detecte when a students is getting bored of a lesson, and will change it to a more pleasing one. It will change to better acommidate the student's needs.\\n\\nFACS can also help the teachers better understand their own students more. Since the FACS system can read the six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It will help the teacher know what their students are feeling. Teachers will know more about their students, and will be able to form a closer bond with them. The FACS system will help the teacher understand what the student need more help with, and what they are more intrrested in.\\n\\nThe FACS system can read the facial muscles, and this is how it can detacte the emotions of people. It can even identify when someone has mixed emotions, and compares each expression with a neutral face. This is how it can regoinze when students are feeling bored, confused, or any other emotion. The inventor of the FACS system, Dr. Paul Eckman, is the one to classify the six basic emotions. He also was the one that asscociated each with characteristic movemetns of the facial muscles. Like when your frontalis pars lateralis raises your eyebrows when you are suprised, and you orbicularis oris tightens your lips when your angry.

This so-called \"love affair\" between people and their cars, though, has started to diminish, and it may be for the better. In the past, the people who owned the prettiest, loudest, and coolest cars considered themselves to be at the top of an automobile social structure, but now, new generations are starting to move away from buying cars. They\\'ve resorting to walking, bicycling, or taking a form of public transport. Sure, owning cars may make you \"better\" than everyone else, but at what cost?\\n\\nCarbon dioxide emissions are at an all-time high, meaning that cars are harming the world more than helping it.\\n\\nYes, cars will be continue to be seen as cool, and owning cars will continue to be seen as cool, but nevertheless, with green house gases emitted from the tailpipes of cars ripping holes in the Earth\\'s atmosphere, cars seem to be more of an impediment to the cause than an improvement.\\n\\nCountries in Western Europe such as Paris and Germany have recognized that the exponential amounts of smog produced by cars are becoming dangerous. Legislators everywhere are taking cautious steps towards eliminating the gases that have a choke hold their cities. An official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg says \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,\" (Par. 7, Rosenthal). Cities in Paris and Germany are adopting a similar idea- developing cities than have a ban cars.\\n\\nVauban, Germany is one of these cities, dicouraging their 5,500 residents to give up their cars, charging them $40,000 to be able to park in one of the two garages in the city. As a result of these rules, 70% of the families that live in Vauban don\\'t own a car, and 57% sold a car in order to live there (Par. 3, Rosenthal). The citizens are reported to be happier and less tense without a car, claiming that cars were the cause of their stress.\\n\\nCommunites like Vauban are set up in a way that makes life easy for the car-less citizens. In this approach, stores and offices are placed within walking distance from the houses, rather than in malls along some distant highway (Par. 6, Rosenthal). This has effectively reduced the amount of emissions of green-house gases drastically in Germany, and other countries around the world are starting to adopt Vauban\\'s basic precepts in an attempt to make cities more compact (Par. 6, Rosenthal).\\n\\nParis, France is one of these cities that is revolutionizing its transportation. Paris has more smog than any other European counry, with 147 micrograms of particulate matter in the air, compared to 79.7 micrograms in London (Par. 17, Duffer). The smog rivaling that of Beijing, China, attempts were made by the government to reduce this smog, fining motorists for two days if they were found using their cars. France, having tax policies that favored the use of diesel over regular gas, blamed diesel fuel for it\\'s record pollution levels.\\n\\nBogota, Colombia ran into a similar problem with it\\'s high numbers of carbon dioxide emissions. The country has developed an atmosphere improvement campaign in the 1990\\'s, constructing hiking and bicycle paths to encourage people to go \"car-free\". For the Day Without Cars, alternative transportation like taxis, buses, and bicycles are promoted, and violators that use their cars on this day are fined $25. Despite the constant rain, participants still turned out, claiming that \"It\\'s a good oppurtunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution,\" (Par. 24, Selsky).\\n\\nOther cities in Colombia have joined the event such as Cali and Valledupar. The mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, hearing about the revolutionary event says \"These people are genertaing a revolutionary change, anf this is crossing borders,\" (Par 26, Selsky). Since the Day Without Cars\\' institution, parks and sports centers have prospered, sidewalks and roads have been repaved, and traffic congestion has been dramatically reduced (Par. 28, Selsky). The appeal of car culture is decreasing, and it has effected countries all over the world.\\n\\nAn \"incipient shift\" in American\\'s behavior over the last few years sugests that the American people are driving less, buying fewer cars, and getting fewer licenses every year (Par. 29, Rosenthal). The number of miles driven by Americans peaked in 2005, and has been diminishing steadily after that. Due to the recession, the majority of Americans couldn\\'t afford to buy new cars, meaning that less people were driving.\\n\\nMimi Sheller, a sociology professer states that, \"Different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,\" (Par. 35, Rosenthal). What she says is true; carpooling, van and public transportation services, and bike-sharing programs are the most populat they\\'ve ever been. Shifts in the population of drivers may accelerate the current trend, and the \"cash-strapped\" Americans that can\\'t afford a car may never actually have to buy one.\\n\\nThe teenage and young adult population has been affected by this cultural shift aswell, with many teenagers not bothering to get a liscence. They figure out other ways to get around, and revolve their schedules arounf where they can walk or which friend they can ride with. Driving by young people is at an all-time low, dropping by 23% between 2001 and 2009 (Par. 41, Rosenthal). Many young people are adopting the ideas that owning, or even driving vehicles is impractical, or even undesirable. This mind-set, in turn, is reducing green house gas emissions unintentionally.\\n\\nOver the years car and culture trends have changed multiple times, and this trend occurring now is probably the best one yet. Reducing carbon dioxide and green house gas emissions is very important, and this current philosophy and outlook on cars is aiding the elimination of those harmful gases. \"Pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commecial and public traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" (Par. 43, Rosenthal). Overall, this idea is helping the Eath, unlike the many ideas before it.

They are the future altohugh no one knows that 100% I believe that they are becasue as my generation and as the next generation grows sure we are all verry smart but we dont use our potential anymore at all. For example this is one of the esiest test and yet some people still fail it. How I do not know the answer to that. Anyways my point is that we are lazy really lazy and we want people/ AI\\'s to do our jobs and objectives for us so we dont have to put in any work. Has it always been this way? sometimes I ask myself this question and no it hasent. I have whitnessed many things in my lifetime and I have done a lot in my lifetime. Personaly the google car is great I have seen them and many poeple I know have tested them, But what have we learned about evolution its good and bad well just think of the whole Jurasic Park story the pople want more they get more and then they somehow mess it up. There are many people who belive it is good and then there are the ones who think it is bad I personaly think it is a step in the wrong way, becasue it makes us worse as a human race. Sure not everyone would be able to afford one but eventualy they will and we will al be like the movie Walle have you seen that movie its messed up a bunch of overweight people in a space ship probably becasue they had self driving cars lets be real. All jokes aside we could and it is verry likely to end up like that. Not just from self driving cars but also from thinks that will come after that maybe next we will have self flying planes and that would put me ou tof my job of being a pilot. Just think of how many kids dreams are being crushed that want to be drivers for people they can\\'t do that anymore because all the cars will be driving themselvse. Yea think about all the little kids dreams you are crushing. Also what would happen to insurance on cars if you mess up now is it your fault or the cars fault and then in turn the manufactures fault. This was what paragraph nine was about. This would crush our economy, sure people would be buying the car-> Great for the company-> Not great for jobs. maybe you could tell those insurance companies and drivers \"Hey since we took your job and messed up your whole life lets put you in a factory where you can build more cars like the ones that ohh wait rememer those the ones that TOOK YOUR JOB\" yea happy ending right? People would get payed a lot less and if google was the only one who released it then that is called a monopaly yes you thinking like the game yea you know where you try to buy out basicaly the whole economy just for one thing and you better hope you dont land on the go to jail spot becasue if you do your SOL (well im sure you know what that means). i hope i made someone laugh not its not the best essay but you have gottent this far and i hope you laughed at least a little. \"Ohh but wait theres more for only $4.99 you could own your verry own self driving car and (wait for it) and free airfreshener\" well thats dandy lets buy one i got to get that google airfreshener it probably smells amazing. No it doesnt you know why because it doesnt exist. probably does honestly. So there are two ways you can go about this the world can get stupider and stupider with this evolution and the people in the world its like a circus not good at all but then AI would control the world ohh thats fine lets just you know give our nukes to computer and hope that it doesnt get mad at us and blow us up. see then the AI would hold the most power in the world the president would be like one atom in sometihng that has 100,000,000 atoms thats like a fly on a winsheild its powerless. You know you shouldnt kill flys on winsheilds you know why? hmm ill tell you later you just have to keep reading. this is probably a pain for you to read. But this is very well what could happen in not my lifetime nor yours becasue your obviosuly older than me whoever is grading this paper. Im guessing about a few generations that self driving cars will be the norm maybe my lifetime probably not thought hmm I dont know.\\n\\nOhh yes that was just my introduction are you read for the next two paragraphs that you have to read. Well first guess what this one is also wabout self driving cars but it is about there saftey (with more jokes). Why does the car cross the road??? ... To get to the other side I know pretty good I came up with that one myself. Ohh wait they die thats what happends when you kill flys on the winsheild the fly dies after it cries and tries to synthisize. you know as a human you can control that, but as a car that is opperated by an AI it wouldnt know if you kiled the fly or not it could just turn on the wippers and gone that fly is. Also the person is at risk if the car messes up and your not paying attention then waht happens you could get hurt really badly and whoes fault is it then how do you prove in court that the car crashed not you or what if the car wanted to crash becasue it didnt like you and you treated it poorly. Also whay happens if you are speeding and then the cop pulls you over and says sir do you know how fast you were going and you so no my car was driving itself sorry sir. Then is it your fault or the cars.\\n\\nIn the end it all boils down to a few things you know after it evaporates. you have you and your car and its your choice in the end.', 'score': '2', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '2.0', 'Line number': '9358', 'gpt_coherence_y': '2.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

      "{'inputs.question': 'Some cities are making themselves car-free. Like in Vauban, Germany; Paris; Bogota, Colombia; and even the president of the United States is trying to \"curb the United States\\' greenhouse gas emissions\" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 29). In Vauban, Germany residents of a community are \"going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: the have given up their cars\" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 1).Some advantages of limiting car usage is people are happier without cars and it promotes the alternative transportation and reduce smog.\\n\\nThe first advantage of limiting car usage is that people are happier without cars. \"The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city\\'s mayor\" (Selsky, Paragraph 27). \"As a result, 70 pecent of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\"\" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 3). \"It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without cars in this capital city of 7 million\" (Selsky, Paragraph 21). \"Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called \"smart planning\"\"(Rosenthal, Paragraph 4). Finally \"the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work\" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 35).\\n\\nThe second advantage of limiting car usage is that it promotes the alternative transportation and it reduces smog. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\"(Duffer, Paragraph 10). \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known os one of the most polluted cities in the world\" (Duffer, Paragraph 14). \"millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams\" (Selsky, Paragraph 20). Also \"the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped speadily thereafter.... As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995\" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 32). And \"people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession mat find less reason to resum the habit\" (Rosenthal,Paragraph 36). But finally \"Mine (19 and 21) have not botheres to get a driver\\'s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends\" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 39).\\n\\nAnd those are the reasons why some cities are making themselves car-free. People are a lot more happy with no cars as said from Elisabeth Rosenthal \"\"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\". And also because people are trying to promote the alternative transportation and reduce smog, thats why Paris \"enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\" (Duffer, Paragraph 10).

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.'' This reveals that even though they know it's dangerous and people doubt them that they should not go to Venus. That it's human curiosity, if people want to explore it they should because it's something they want to know about. Probably will lead or help us in the future to make this possible for people to go, less dangerous to go as well if they find a way to go.\\n\\nThe knowledge of a human should never be doubt. Venus is a dangerous palce to go because humans aren't able to go and actaully see it for themselves.

Even though this text from the passage says that it won't be safe there is still a possible chance that humans can. If humans explore it around it would be safe for them, but like catching things on camera it wouldn't be the best quality that they want. The people who want to explore and are wiling to take a risk to figure about about a palnet that most people don't want to explore because of the dangers.

In paragraph 7 the passage says '' NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.''

Is this technology to read emotinal expressions of humans wrong? How do they make this technology to read people\\'s emotions? Who\\'s idea was this?\\n\\nFirst, I think reading people\\'s mind\\'s by this technology is wrong. First reason is it\\'s none of our bussines. Also reading people\\'s minds is something that is totally creepy. This technology can detect anyone who\\'s happy, sad, angry, and disgusted. Everyone has their own personal secrets that he or she doesn\\'t want to reveal their feelings. They need to invent something to help people around the world.\\n\\nSecond, this idea came from Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Instatute for Advanced Science at the University of Illionois, working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are exports at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Both of these professors want\\'s to know of their invention to the world to earn credit. Do they even know what their doing? Both professors test\\'s the painting of Mona Lisa of her emotions. Mona Lisa results is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.\\n\\nThen, this software technology has a constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 majors muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an \"action unit\". Then Dr. Hunag relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS ( Facial Action Coding System. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions ( as in da Vinci\\'s masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

The electoral college may turn off potential voters because they may have the mind set that one vote does not matter because the president will be chosen by the electoral college anyways. The electoral college does not nessicarily speak for the people because the majority vote for a certain canidate will take all of the electoral college votes in one state.

In the article it says \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, nut the air pressure would be close that of sea level on Earth.\" This tells us that the planet Venus\\'s temperature would be very high for them to go there but the sea levels of the Earth would be close so the people would be able to survive in the planet.

The face was located in Cydonia it is two miles long from end to end. It looked like a face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. It is actually a mesa. Then,in 1998 the MOC wanted to take another picture because many people were saying that it was created by aliens. This picture would be in movies,books,magazines,radio talk shows and even in grocery stores for twenty five years.\\n\\nWhen NASA let the public see this picture they believed it was created by aliens. We went back in 1998 and took some more pictures and it had still looked like a face but it was not. My people said that we (NASA) would rather hide then say that there was life on Mars, many conspiracy theorists were saying. We wouldn\\'t hide we would tell the public so that we could get more money to be able to go to Mars and see these aliens.\\n\\nWhat some people wanted was aliens and other people didn\\'t. Mostly all the scientists at NASA including myself did not believe that the\"face\" was created by aliens. So in 2001 we went again to Mars to get a picture of the \"face\". It would be a clearer picture because the cameras were ten times better than the cameras in 1976 and in 1998. It was very hard to get to that exact spot on Mars. The face on Mars was 41 degrees north martian latitude. On April 8,2001 it was summer in Cydonia when we had taken the picture in 1998 it was winter and it was very cloudy.

      "{'inputs.question': 'When it comes to automobiles they can provide us with numerous benefits. However, it would appear that limiting car use has far more advantages than thought of before: it can help the enviorment, provide easier means of commuting, and it can cut down on traffic congestion.\\n\\nTo begin, it would appear as though that limited car usage is a enviorment saving technique. For instance, within the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states of the exsistence of a small suburban city names Vauban, Germany that has nearly obsoleted the use of automobiles. Within the fifth paragraph of the article they talk of why it is so necessary for this to become a trend,\"Automobiles are the linchpin of subarbs... And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...\". This bit of information informs those that drive of the harmful effects that our cars are creating upon the enviorment. However, if we are to limit our uses of cars, and like the residents of Vauban, and find alternative means of transportation then maybe we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are being given off by cars. Similarly, Paris has taken up a similar idea. In Robert Duffer`s article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" he talks of the percautions that France has taken to driving and why. Paris has created a ban so that those who have a liscense plate that begins with an even number cannot drive on a certain day, and the next day those who have a liscense plate that starts with an odd number cannot drive. This all began because, \"...after five-days of intensifying smog... [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\"(paragraph 14). Paris`s efforts to create less smog was a success and they now implement the ban on Monday`s and Tuesday`s. Due to less drivers, they were even able to reduce the amount of smog polluting the air. Limited and restrictive usage on cars seems to be very helpful when saving the enviorment.\\n\\nNext, the near obsolete use of cars has made for easier modes of transportation. For example, in Elisabeth Rosenthal`s passage \" \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" she tells of the many benifits that limited car use have upon their community. In paragraph six she states that suburbs are beginning to be,\"...more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\" This meaning that there will be more of an ease when traveling and everything being closer together. No longer will people have to drive miles away for some groceries, they will simply either walk or ride the bus to their destination. They will no longer be stressed as to what time they have left to reach a store that is a distance away. Along the same lines, soemtimes it can be easier to not drive at all. In the article \"The End of Car Culture\" the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal, states how many people have found diffrent means of getting to where they are going. In paragraph thirty-seven she says,\" New York`s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities...\". From the information given, it appears as though finding easier means of transportation have become a new popular trend. Since prices to travel by car are soaring, the cheapier solution appears to just be walking, or as stated, riding a bike. Leading people to belive that the near extinction of car usage has left us with easier means of travel.\\n\\nLastly, choosing to not use cars more frequently has left us with less traffic. In Andrew Selsky`s \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" he talks about\\xa0 the reasoing for this. \"...millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\"(paragraph 20). Due to the enviormentaly safe means of travel, traffic has become a thing of the past. This can also mean for the residents, a faster, safer way of traveling if they take a taxi or bus to their destination. Even Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company had input to this. Elisabeth Rosenthal was able to incorporate a statement into her article \"The End of Car Culture\" when on the subject of the decline in car usage. Mr. Ford had to say that, \"...pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" (paragraph 43). This statement can inform the general population that from the drop in cars on the road, it can improve our safety and save time because of the fewer motorist on the road. That traffic is nearing an end which can be a new age in which traffic is gone. Which is why, when people choose not to use cars it can help to reduce traffic.\\n\\nIn conclusion, when it comes to automobiles they can provide us with numerous benefits. However, it would appear that limiting car use has far more advantages than thought of before: it can help the enviorment, provide easier means of traveling, and it can reduce traffic.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Dear Senator,\\n\\nMany people might agree that we shouldn\\'t have an Electoral College at all, since most of the time it doesn\\'t seem to work at all since of instead just voting on the person or candidate you would prefer, you instead vote for a slate of electors instead of the prefered candidate. This is not the case, however, and in fact, the Electoral College does seem to function. It can be proven in two simple reasons on why the Electoral College still works- certainty of outcome and the simple fact that it\\'s everyone\\'s president.\\n\\nForemost, the certainty of outcome can eaisly prove why the Electoral College still works. If we even do go to a system where we actually vote for popular vote, it would work as well as we do right now with the Electoral College, since there will be more disputes on popular vote than on the Electoral College. In Richard A. Posner\\'s article on the defense for the Electoral College, he states in his first reason on why their would be much dispute over popular vote than on the Electoral College, and why it\\'s less likely to happen on a Electoral College. He states \"The reason is that the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\" It\\'s true, after all that the Electoral College\\'s votes exceed over the popular votes. It could be also said that even if the government actually switches to popular vote, we know it would work since it does not exceed how on Electoral College votes go, which can be also seen as a simpler process of voting. On another note, in some cases, there can be ties between two candidates, as seen in 1992\\'s Election between Nixon and Clinton on the popular vote. To summarize, the certainty of outcome is far greater in the Electoral College rather than the popular vote due to sheer number of votes in the Electoral College.\\n\\nOn a second note, the fact that the american people can vote enough that it\\'s everyone\\'s president is another reason on why the Electoral Colllege does work. The Electoral College works by havng the winner win trans-regionally rather than just focus on just on region that just favors them and only them. So instead of one region getting the candidate that prefers and focuses on only them, everyone can have a candidate that will focus largely on the nation\\'s issues rather than just a specific part ot the country. For example, let\\'s say that the largest population of people in a regon in the United States is the south (not saying it is or isn\\'t, it\\'s just an example). The south is mainly republican, so they will only vote for a republican that will focus majorly on the south. It is unfair for the rest of the regions, such as the Northeast, Middle, Pacific, and other regions of the United States, since they are mainly democratic (not really, it is used as an example) who would want focus on their region as well, too. In Bradford Plumers\\'s article on why the Electoral College should be gone, he states that the electoral college is unfair to voters, since most candidates did not bother with the states they know they have no chance of winning at all. There could be an easy counter argument against this, since those states have probably already made up their minds on who to vote for, like a democratic candidate visiting Texas (where it\\'s mainly republican), they know who Texas is going to vote for, there is no use in trying to convince them when they have already made up their minds, same goes if a republican candidate tries to convince the democratic California, they already know there is no use in reasoning and convincing when someone has already made up their mind. Also, someone can easily counterattack most of the arguments brought up in th Plumer\\'s article, since this was written before the 2004 election, and it has been a decade already, plenty of things could\\'ve changed during the course if ten years in politics. In order to make a greater argument against the electoral college, one must have an updated list of facts in order to back it up, as certain things could\\'ve changed during a certain course of a decade. During the course of a decade, we seen how affective the electoral college was during the 2004 elections (people who disagreed during the 2004 elections and also agree that the electoral college doesn\\'t work at all have to see the events that transpired before the 2004 elections and the promises made before it also), the 2008 elections (again, if the people disagreed on how the electoral college worked at that time, you would need to look at how people saw change during that time and the amount of younger citizens voting at that time), and the 2012 elections as well (also again, if disagreeing with the electoral college is reasonable at that time, you would need to look at how people reacted at that time and how different events before the election affected the outcome). In a final note, the electoral college is the vote on the people\\'s president is true, and withholds it since it can focus on rather than on one specific region, but the nation as a whole.\\n\\nIn summarization, the electoral college should be kept due to the simple reasoning of certainty of outcome and the voting on the people\\'s president. The reasoning of certainty of outcome can be applied here is due to the simple fact that the votes for the electoral college are far more greater than the votes for popular vote, same goes to the voting on the people\\'s president, since it focuses on the entire nation rather that just one region of the country. Senator, we should be able to keep our electoral college, as it proves effective during the recent elections, and can certainly prove itself useful and reliable during the next elections to come.

Happy with how the world is growing up and acting or ashamed on how it is pleading to those who live in it to finally change for the better which isn\\'t happening. Yet some children of mother nature or\\xa0of the universe do believe that only living off of the non-materialistic ideas in life can help you get farther. However many people take pride in indulging on the sins that used excessively can\\'t get them out of the hole they were forced into. Sterotypical people who contradict themseleves or those whom tend to be hypocrytes for that they don\\'t understand always fail to stand for the better. I believe, that in all honesty, no one should be happy with the location of where they stand in society. Due to how far technology has gotten not even within the past two centuries, it must be stopped as a whole. Now let\\'s actually discuss our main objective to throw out the window. The topic to fully dive into, based upon facts and personal opinions, Can stopping the mechanical reproduction of automobiles truly help the world out?\\n\\nJust think about it, what are the possibilies that are being entitled within this topic in particular;\\xa0but most importantly is there any way the upcoming generations can switch everything or everyone\\xa0around, to change the mindset of all of the billions of people living on the planet to make it up for the better since we all know the way we are heading is not the place we should go? How fast or slow can this idea be put into place? The world we now know is indeed needing to be resureccted based alone on how much harm we have caused within the past few centuries. If you rely on technology too much doesnt that hurt yourself even more in the long run? Strategies or new found plans should be taken into consideration based on the facts presented and dismissed in the past because the way we are living and teaching those those who are newly born, should know that the world around them isn\\'t right anymore, and direly needs help to improve. The society we are now dealing with, needs to play a new game or the world will end in more corruption than originally thought would happen. In all, isn\\'t it\\xa0good sometimes, to think about what is wrong and what you could do to help out? Now just sit and think to see where your own mind could lead you. Down the path were the world is once again healthy and happy? Or the path of destruction?\\n\\nThe path of destruction can lead to many implications based on health, or survival of the fittest, based on social status or skills gained in a hard cold world mostly dependent on how or when you grew up, due to how society changes over time. Scientists know based on their own work that the atmosphere can only handle so much pollution until it gives out and the world as we do know, learn, and live with can die. Do you want to see the slow demise of where you live, the place where is the only home known to man of the human species? Seeing death upon the streets due to failing natural health means, does it not actually hurt the heart to see such things? Plus car\\'s do take too much space needed for other necesisties such as more room or storage to live a basic daily life in. Yes we may have the technology to fix natural things artificially but does it make it right to think that it will work? Cars cause pollution, pollution cases for health issues, health issues lead to over crowding at the hospital with disease, work load increases and those who work will tire and then eventually get sick themselves for which the most able to achieve end for this ongoing process could be death. Now do you understand where I might be getting at? Being sick mentally or physically is just the first step into a change in mind where all can go to hell and break loose or done in a good way, could change the future generations to restart where we all began. This is all just the basics of the wrong path imagine what could happen if nothing is done to stop the hurting and resume the healing.\\n\\nAlthough that is the begining of an era that could happen due to stupidity or greed could you do us all a favor and imagine a realistic dream of\\xa0what could happen if we dropped technology as a whole? All the metals could be recycled for greater purposes! Cars will lead us to see a whole new or happier society where socializing could be the end of all problems. Our health will be in tip top shape, everyone will finally understand what it could mean to live in harmony. Money not spent on transportation could be saved for greater purposes similar to expenses for your child\\'s college maybe even for the advancement of useful environmentally friendly sciences to be learned or help funded or whichever other purpose you can think of. Yes one bad point is that many jobs could be lost but there is always back up plans that you could create for the worst case scenario. However, otherwise society will be happy and health issues should decrease if many of us chose to instead walk or use a bicycle to our destination, so isnt that a better dream to dream? \"Keep Moving forward\" as stated by Walter Disney, can that dream not be achieved by any means to increase the chances of a world where anything is possible to demand or chase after? Failure doesnt mean to give up but to rather keep trying to improve the ratio of failing to succeding. Cars may be important now, but in an alternate universe, what if they were never invented?\\n\\nIn conclusion these familes who are giving up their main source of transportation unless required, they are doing the right thing by taking the first step into a new way of life. Giving up cars is giving up the chance to accidentally hurt those by made a bad desicion. Althought depleting these choices of actions will or should decrease if this topic remains to be included as a new trend for a lack of better word majorly helpful to whose with crime records of the possibility of earning. Fighting with reason is better than to not fight at all. If your standing and doing nothing to help the environment around you, then don\\'t you think you should consider the consequences for future generations down the road? Consider both sides of the argument, which is right or which is wrong to proceed with? The happier life versus the hurting of the world? I can only do nothing but act upon myself to show that what is going on is a coincidence merely to the fact that you are here reading my words. Can my words help from afar or not at all can only be determined by yourself.\\n\\nSo be wise and consider, do you chose left for healing or right for hurting?       \\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0    ', 'score': '3', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '10379', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

      "{'inputs.question': 'I profoundly believe that the United States should not keep the Electoral College because the person who has the popular vote may not win presidency, and the \"winner take all\" system causes voters in certain states to not feel like they are creating an impact. The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established in the constition. The electoral college consits of 538 electors and a majority of 278 votes.\\n\\nIn our voting system even if a candidate receives more votes than their opponents he or she still could lose the election because of the electoral college. Here is a prime example, in the 2000 election Al Gore won the popular vote but because he had less electoral votes than Bush he unfourtunetly lost the election. According to Bradford Plumer \"over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" It seems rather logical that if somebody gains the most votes in an election that the country would prefer that canidate to be the president. For that reason alone the reader should side with the idea to abolish the electoral college. Now besides somebody receiving more or less electoral votes, perhaps the candidates tied. In this case it gets thrown to the House Of Representitives which will cause a Wyoming Rep. with 500,000 voters to have just as much say as a California Rep. with 35,000,000 voters. All a tie would do is corrupt the voting system even more than it is. For those reasons there should be an indefinite ban on the electoral college.\\n\\nAdditionally the winner take all method in some states makes voters feel unimportant. Some may argue that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president but regions do have the power to swing an election in an enourmous way. An effect of the winner take all system is candidates not going to certain states if they know they can not win it. This can basically stop some voters from wasting time and voting because they may feel there personal vote would make no difference. In the 2000 election \"17 states did not see candidates at all.\" according to Bradford Plumer. How could somebody possibly feel engaged in an election if whoever is running finds there vote unimportantant to them winning the election.\\n\\nIn conclusion it is official that the electoral collage is unfair, out dated, and irrational. With that being said we should abolish it because it stops the voter who has the majority of votes from winning, and can undoubtably make voters feel unimportant.

In the text the author states, \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encount on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of pur oceans and would liquefy many metals.\" This piece of information from the text is saying that here on Earth we have humans diving into the deepest parts of the oceans, with protective gear (a submarine), to explore the unknown. However, if we would to send a human to Venus, with protective gear ( a spaceship), they would not surive because the heat Venus has melts metals and would destroy the spaceship. The author then states, \"Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.\" In this piece of text the author is stating that yes, even though Earth has volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and lighting we do not have those weather conditions because someone is trying to study the Earth. That piece of information is saying that if we were to send a spaceship out to Venus it would be impossible for it to land because Venus has volcanes, powerful earthquakes, and lighting strikes to prevent probes from landing on its surface.

Both candidates running for president has either his or her own team of electors who all have there own unique job as a party.\\n\\nBut with this system it can cause problems with bugs, viruses, and etc. People often ask whats wrong with the electoral college? ''Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president''. The new voting system is not fair to voters. Because of the winner takes all in each state. ''Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It\\'s a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it\\'s better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city and/or regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a time-consuming place.\\n\\nTo begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almost-broken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France\\'s tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter\\'s. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia\\'s capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars \"was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it\\'s life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semi-trucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashes/accidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation\\'s miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.\\n\\nMoreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being \"the city that never sleeps\", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bike-sharing program, and it\\'s skyrocketing bridge/tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we\\'ll do after they\\'ve been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our number-one priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don\\'t use a car. Try a new way to get to work; taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds; or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember: it\\'s not the destination that yiou should look forward to; it\\'s the journey.

      "{'inputs.question': 'The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. Not only is it far too outdated and complicated to help our voting process, but the Electoral College does not give the voters voice; instead, it takes it away from them. The Electoral College also can lead to concerning situations that the country and its people do not want to be put in. For these reasons, I strongly encourage you to make the change and switch to election by popular vote.\\n\\nThe question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" a poll was taken by Gallup in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an up-to-date election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, \"What Is the Electoral College,\" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College should no longer be the voting method of the American people because the people are given no voice with the Electoral College process. In his article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn\\'t make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.\\n\\nMost importantly, using the Electoral College as our voting method can lead to some serious problems. The replacing of electors that oppose the popular vote result is a problem that comes with using the Electoral College. Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote.\\n\\nIn summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.       \\xa0    ', 'score': '5', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '11346', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

      "{'inputs.question': 'Have you ever realized how driving everywhere isn\\'t always the best way to get places? Well, there are a few advantages of limiting car usage for fellow citizens. Think about it, cars aren\\'t all that great, yeah they get you to your destination much faster than, let\\'s say walking or maybe even riding a bike, but that isn\\'t always a good thing. Bikes and walking are so much easier than driving everywhere because in order to drive to your destination you must have gasoline in your vehicle. If you were to walk to your specific destination you will not only get excercise but you can also walk with a friend, it will give you time to hang out with others and be social! Limiting car usage will also limit the amount of accidents on the roads everyday. It will end the \"texting and driving\" situation throughout the streets. The less people driving the safer the ones that do drive will be. People don\\'t realize what cars do that are bad, all of us only see the good in vehicles because we don\\'t want to have to push ourselves to change for the better.\\n\\nOh my! $2.56 for a gallon of gasoline will add up very quickly! That isn\\'t the only gasoline that is affecting people either, there is also greenhouse gas from cars driving by. \"And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emisions from tailpipes...\" (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars (IGS) Paragraph 5 Line 3-4). The greenhouse gas percentage has gotten very high going from Europe to the United States, it is getting quite out of hand if you ask me. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" (Source 1 (IGS) Paragraph 5 Lines 4-6). Prices on gasoline stand very high now a days and it is bringing people downhill because the higher the price the less money they begin to have until they can\\'t go out anymore. In result to trying to solve the pollution of gasoline problem the fined who ever it was that was causing the situation. \"Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters... [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.\" (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog (PBDS) Paragraph 12 Lines 1-3). I believe that every country, state and city should take at least one day out of the year and make it a no driving day. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" (Source 2: (PBDS) Paragraph 10 Lines 1-2). If we do the same as Paris we can clear the air and not worry about the pollution as much but there are still other disadvantages for car usage.\\n\\nLifting weights? Joining a gym? Those are all good ways to get your excercise but really you could just get in the habit of walking to wear you need to go and get more excercise than you would in the gym. \"While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs.\" (Source 1 (IGS) Paragraph 6 Lines 1-3). Making the cities denser will mean that the citizens who live in them can walk to the stores and resturaunts down the street instead of driving. \"In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\" (Source 1 (IGS) Paragraph 6 Lines 8-10). Not to mention the traffic while driving! Walking to your destination will make getting places so much more afficient because you won\\'t have to be late to a meeting or even work at that matter if it is walking distance. \"Congestion (car traffic) was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog...\" (Source 2: (PBDS) Paragraph 14 Lines 1-2). If there are less cars on the street and more people on the sidewalks, the world wouldn\\'t be so gloomy. No one is social anymore, they don\\'t care for others they only care for themselves and that is very wrong. If the limit of car usage decreases, the more people will want to walk and be social with others.\\n\\nWatch out for that....! *crash!* Safety is so important when you are driving, accidents happen so quickly and if you aren\\'t careful it could be you. This is another reason why limiting car usage is a rather good idea because it will cause accidents to happen less often than they do now. Car accidents happen everyday, maybe to a complete stranger or to someone you know, either way walking is safer. \"In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" (Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota (CFDB) Paragraph 20 Lines 1-4). Walking to places is more, what\\'s the word I\\'m looking for..? Oh! Walking is more social and safe, if you took one whole day without using your car, you could walk and as others catch on to why you are walking they will begin to walk along with you and you will develop the idea that walking is more fun and safe than driving. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturaunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" (Source 3: (PBDS) Paragraph 28 Lines 1-4). More people will begin to go out and walk for fun after getting in the habit of going with you and you can enjoy the world so much more knowing that the air isn\\'t being as polluting and there won\\'t be a many car accidents. You will save yourself and whoever follows through with you to limit the usage or cars and other vehicles.\\n\\nGet a few of your friends together and go for a bike ride to the mall! There are some advantages of limiting car usage. Being in your car, whether it be alone or with others, is quite boring. You get to places very quickly but also don\\'t have the experience that you could if you try something different. Try walking to the mall or a resturaunt not so close to you and bring some of your friends, see if you have more of a good time walking than you would driving. Driving is too expensive, you need to pay insurance to drive as well as paying to get gasoline. \"With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.\" (Source 4: The End Of Car Culture (TEOC) Paragraph 36 Lines 1-2). People are beginning to realize that cars are not all that great and don\\'t do good for the world, they pollute the air we breathe. The less people to drive the better our cities will be, they will start to have less pollution in the air, less car accidents and more excercise to walk and bike to where you need to be. Be the one to make the clear the air day, and be a role model, show others why you decided to limit car usage.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Venus is an unknown planet, despite being so close to us. It is hostile, and no human could survive on its surface. But some think it is possible to reach the surface and study Venus up close. It has many dangers in the way of progress. It\\'s clouds contain sulfuric acid, and it\\'s thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. The pressure on the surface in 90 times greater than that of Earth, and temperatures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It boasts the hottest surface tempuature of any planet in the solar system, and has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent bursts of lightning that impeade probes and rovers exploring the surface. But some think it is still a possiblity to go to the hostile planet. The author of the article believes it is possible to reach and explore the surface despite the danger. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in presents by explaining that it may have once been earth-like a very long time ago, that it is the closest planet to Earth for exploration, and how scientists are now testing ways to get on the surface without any casualties.\\n\\nThe author gives support by explaining the fact the surface of Venus was once earth-like, and that it had many of the features that Earth has on it\\'s current surface. It is amazing to think that such a unsuitable planet could have once been eath-like, but being near as it is to Earth, it is not entirely impossible. The author tells how many have made comparisons to Earth based on it\\'s current surface, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because of it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system....Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" The feature the author talks about are very Earth-like, so the possiblity of it once being like a \"utopain\" planet are not dim. He point out the valleys, mountains, and craters that can be seen around the surface. Maybe the craters were the cause of the hostility on the planet, and it\\'s inhabitent were wiped off the planet by a imbargement of asteriods and possibly comets. And the crashs caused climate change, thus shifting the planet into it\\'s demise for supporting life. But if it is so close, couldn\\'t this be true, that Venus was once in the Goldilocks Zone, and while Earth formed, Venus was the planet of life. After all, it is our neighbor.\\n\\nThe author continues to support his ideas of exploration by pointing out the fact that Venus is, at most times, the closest planet to us, Mars being a bit more distant. It is often called our sister planet, as we have very much in common with Venus. The author explains how closly were related to Venus, and why we chose to explore it, \"Often referred to as Earth\\'s \\'twin\\', Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desity and size.....Futhermore, recall the Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.\" It is about the same size, and relativly close, so it is one of the obvious choices. It is also noted that in space, time matters. If you don\\'t get to the planet quick, your ship could lose oxygen, your could run out of food, or you might miss the planet when it goes through rotation, making harder to get home and less likely to reach the planet another time. Although it is hard to make the surface of Venus, it is our closest option and is more like us, thus making it more suitable. The question for scientists is how. This question may not be solved for a long time, but already, scientists are making advaces toward the next landing on Venus.\\n\\nThe author also supports his idea of Venus exploration by showing ways that people are making advaces toward a possible landing. New technologies and old technologies alike are being combined to make the landing last, and for futher exploration. The author shares some of the developments made by scientist recently, \"Imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitide to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground condition by staying up and out of thier way.\" Another advance includes using new material the protect electronics and other computer equipment in the hostile environment, \"NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of the Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\" NASA has made significant advance in the pursuit of getting onto the most Earth-like hostile planet in the solar system. New discoveries continue to be made, and soon the expedition for Venus will be underway.\\n\\nThe author has supported his claim throughout the article that studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining it\\'s likeness to Earth, it\\'s closeness in proximity, and how scientists are advancing closer toward the goal of landing. Humans have done things like this before. The 1969 moon landings, for example, were thought to be impossible, but through human drive and motivation, we achieved this goal, and now we are faced with a new challenge, Venus. But with the same human drive and motivation that put man on the moon, people will explore our \"twin\" planet, and uncover it\\'s greatest secrets.

      "{'inputs.question': \"The electoral college is one of the most heavily criticized institutions in the American government system. It has been considered outdated and anti-democratic. However, without it, the balance of power in America would be skewed to an unacceptable degree. States with large populations would be disproportionately empowered, without the electoral college. This leaves the smaller states' existence to be controlled by the larger states, to the dismay of the American economy and people.\\n\\nAs it stands, most states vote in a way that presents a united front of electors to the electoral college. If just over half of the Californian voters vote for one candidate that they think would represent their interests, the map in source 3 shows that all 55 electors will present their votes to the college. It is better for California to be represented in this way so that the Californian economy would not be adversely effected by their minority voters. That sort of united front is beneficial to every state in the union, for the same reason.\\n\\nThe argument that the electoral college discourages voters of the minority party to vote is a valid criticism, but it is a problem that can be solved without the loss of the electoral college. Compulsory voting would be far more effective if voter turnout is an issue. People who would not have voted otherwise would still likely vote for the candidate they supported if voting was made mandatory.\\n\\nIn source 2, Bradford Plumer expressed dissatisfaction with the way political campaigns involving the electoral college focus on swing states rather than allowing equal debate in all states, but that does not make for a less desirable outcome. Dissolving the electoral college would make swing states irrelevant to presidential elections, as it'd be impossible to win votes in those states by any decent margin. Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed.\\n\\nThe electoral college might not be the best potential method for presidential elections. It is, however, far more desirable for such a large country than popular vote. Popular vote would lead to neglecting many areas of the economy that are important, but do not have a presence in states with large populations. It would make elections more one sided for each state at the same time. The problems the opponents say abolishing it would fix, would be fixed without it, but doing so would create far more problems than it solved. It is also easy enough to fix the same problems without abolishing the electoral college.    \", 'score': '5', 'gpt_coherence_x': '4.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '11572', 'gpt_coherence_y': '5.0', 'gpt_relevance': '5.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",

The differences in Artice two: (My own words) Paris baned driving due to smog is because when you started up your car and it pushes out all that gas pollution afterwards that goes into the car put not knowing were its going someone could in heal that gas pollution and get sick. for instants \" Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has.... atax policy that favors over gasoline\" Let\\'s just these gases is used to make up the car.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Driverless cars, once thought to be only a far off and unattainable concept, are now a realistic possibilty in our near future. Already, manufacturers have developed working prototypes of driverless cars. With the possibility of them being an interactive part of our future, the topic as a whole begs discussion. Are they safe? How do they work? Will they ever be completely driverless? These are all valid questions, deserving of valid answers. While work is still being done on these cars, they are a safe, and should continue to be developed.\\n\\nDriverless cars could bring an entirely new face to public transportation. The future of these cars hold not only the possibility of completely autonomous vehicles, but also ones that are more energy efficient. If the whole of a cities transportation system would go driverless, the system itself would be much more efficient. Unlike a cab driven by a human, driverless cabs do not have to stop for lunch breaks or other trivial and very human matters. The text states, \"Google cofounder Sergey Brin...envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today\\'s taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.\" This quote from a leader in the field of driverless cars shows that driverless cars offer a real possibilty for a much more efficient and flexible transportation system.\\n\\nReal possibilities stand in the horizion for driverless automobiles. As of right now, cars are not completely driverless, as the text states, \"Google cars aren\\'t truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.\" However, given the amount of progress the company has made since they began testing independently driving cars in 2009, it can be assumed that they will make more progress, and eventually develop a car that can drive completely independent. There is a real future in the field of driverless cars, and the only way to find out what it holds is to continue its development.\\n\\nThe development of driverless cars will also be beneficial to more than just the industry of driverless cars itself. The technology used in the cars can be applied to more than just the cars. The text states, \"There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren\\'t there, the computers weren\\'t there, and the mapping wasn\\'t there. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn\\'t something you could buy at Radio Shack.\" All the forms of technology listed above are found in driverless cars, but they are also found in many other different areas of science and life itself. The technology that became available was not limited to a single use. No technology is. Science is an inclusive, interactive, and widespread concept. No single concept in science is used in only one design. For example, Velcro, developed for use on space suits, is now something used daily by ordinary citizens to keep our bags shut or our shoes tied. As new technology is introduced in the field of driverless cars, it will expand to horizions beyong just the cars themselves.\\n\\nAs much as the development of driverless cars could aid our society, some people still have concerns about them. The biggest concept that concerns citizens is their safety. Many people believe that a truly driverless car is dangerous, and could go rogue, malfunctioning and causing a wreck. However, even though people might not believe these cars are safe, they are. The text states, \"The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel...Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road.\" Cars may one day be 100% driverless, but right now they are not. A human is always in the front seat, ready to take control, and that means these cars are still as safe as a normal car.\\n\\nDriverless cars, while they may only sound like a concept from a science fiction book, are a real possibility, and can affect our near future. Their development is crucial. They could bring about more flexible transportation systems and new technology, and the progress made so far offers substantial proof that this isn\\'t a worthless subject. They are a very real and immenent possiblity in our future, and they should be taken advantage of.

Examples from the passage are, the cars will probably have a hard time navigating through work zones and around accidents. The cars will also have to deal with complicated traffic issues , such as navigating through roadworks or roadblocks that lie ahead for the autonomous car.\\n\\nSecond reason is, they might go out of control. The car might face some technical deflicties and someone will most likely get injured. If some dies get injured who will be at fault? wil it be the driver or the manufacturer. I believe it will be the manufacturer because they made the car and they didnt make sure if it was safe for the people to drive arounfd in or not.\\n\\nMy last reason is They wouldnt be as surportive during deflict stiutions. i think They wouldnt be very surportive because the car might not know what to do. For example, if there was roadblock and the car didnt or couldnt indenify them and the car crushes. What if the car was told to go somewhere and went to wrong way? will it be the cars fault. And if the car got broken down for no reason during traffic will it be okay for other people.\\n\\nIn conclusion i believ that driverless cars wont be as safe as cars driven by humans. i believe this because they wouldnt know when to stop, they might go out of control, and they wouldnt be very surportive during deflict stiutions.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Think about the time you felt extremely tired. That time where you could barely keep your eyes open, everything you heard was a blob, because you were simply zoned out. You were feeling tired. For me this time would be sitting in my english class learning about Shakespeare. I felt as if the time were never ending in that class. Students all around me had the same facial expression on them. Facial expressions are a huge key of communication. When you are out in public you see many faces around, and you can easily assume their emotions and what they are feeling. With technology being a huge factor in tody\\'s society, we can now use it to determine someone\\'s emotion. I believe that using technology to read emotional expressions on students could really bring forth value in classrooms.\\n\\nStudents all over the school have different things going on. They show and deplict off different emotions at an instant. Sometimes these emotions make it hard for students to concentrate in class during instructions or new lessons given by the teachers. Referring back to the article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", Nick D\\'Alto, the writer, writes about a new software called the Facial Action Coding System. The new sytem was developed to determine the accuracy of emotions of people around us. If this software were to be implemented in our school, then this could be an advantage in shaping a better society. The software will help teachers determine the emotions students are feeling at the time of lecture. D\\'Alto quotes Dr. Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicting that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". Once recognizing the emotions of the student, Dr. Huang continues predicting that the software can \"Then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This will help better the student\\'s understanding in a certain subject without feeling sidetracked or confused with the activites of the teacher.\\n\\nAlthough many may argue that the use of this software may bring negative impacts, many like the high cost of implementing it to a public school for everyone to use, or what if the software doesn\\'t work? I could reply by stating that students struggle daily in trying to understand a certain subject in school, this leads them to fail classes or simply drop out of high school. Developing this new software will help students understand their lessons in school and stay focused. The software will also help counselors and teachers determine the emotions of their students. Sadly, many high schoolers have committed suicide because people don\\'t understand what they are feeling, implementing this software to schools will help reduce the rate of suicides and drop outs. In paragraph four of the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the writer states \"By weighting the different units, the software can even indentify mixed emotions.\" This could help people to better understand each other.\\n\\nIn conclusion, technology has greatly impacted our society and future generations. Things all over us are changing, some changes are good and most may even bring forth new ideas, many like this new software. Placing this new software in schools will help keep them out of confusion with their emotions and education. By the use of this software, students will no longer be falling asleep because the software will help the students concentrate better by adjusting to the abilities of the student to learn. The new system will also help decrease the rate of suicide and drop outs in schools. Implementing new technology will only help make our future better. If we have the chance in changing the world and societies for the better, why not start by understanding each other and our emotions?

      "{'inputs.question': 'Have you ever thought about people making driverless cars? People are trying to make driverless cars. I think it is a good idea to make driverless cars, but a lot of people think it is very dangerous. I think it is a good idea because, blind people can ride in driverless cars, it is easier to multi task especially when you have a kid, and when you are traveling far distances you can get a good break. Let me tell you more about the advantages of owning a driverless car.\\n\\nOne advantage of owning a driverless car is that a blind person can get from place to place in a driverless car. Usually a blind person would have to have a dog and a stick and walk. Blind people can get from place to place and easier with a driverless car. You can get from place to place faster with a driverless car, rather than walking everywhere.\\n\\nThe second advantage of owning a driverless car is that it is easier to multi task. When you have a kid or kids it would be great to have the car drive itself, so you can take care of your kids. When multi tasking you can sleep when going on road trips. You can also eat food while the car is taking you somewhere.\\n\\nThe last advantage of owning a driverless car is that you do not have to do anything. You can sleep the whole time and still get place to place. Or you can do what ever you want while in a car.\\n\\nPersonally, I would like the cars to be invented. In the passage the bad thing is when coming upon construction is that the car will tell you when to start driving manually. The other bad thing is that you have to have your hands on the wheel at all times. Other than that I would love to own a driverless car.', 'score': '3', 'gpt_coherence_x': '4.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '11998', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '5.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",
      "{'inputs.question': 'Dear Mr or Ms Senator,\\n\\nPresient Richard Nixon, and President Bill Clinton both have something in common; they won their presidencies with the Electoral College, not the popular vote. (According to \"In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. Paragraph 22) Richard and Bill only won 43% of the popular vote against their opponents while they were running for office. This is why the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of switching to the popular vote for the elections.\\n\\nNow you\\'re probably wondering, does high school students even know what the Electoral College is and what it\\'s job? Yes, high school students do know what the Electoral College is and what it does. The Electoral College is made up of 538 electors. Your state amount equals one member from the House of Represenatives and two from the Senate. The electors are chosen from the candidate\\'s political party. The Electoral College decides the president and vice president every four years every Tuesday ater the first Monday in the month of November.\\n\\nMr or Ms Senator, the Electoral College needs to stay instead of the popular vote because when you have the Electoral College you will get an outcome from it unlike the popular vote. Almost all states have the \"winners take all\" method which according to \"What is te Electoral College\" by the Office of the Federal Regisiter (Paragraph 7) this method is when all electors are awarded to the presidental candidate that is winning. Also the popular vote overrides the popular vote. In \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner (Pararaph 18) the 2012 presidental campaign for example it was the battle between Mitt Romney who is a Republican against Barack Obama who is a Democrat. Obama received only 51.3 percent of the popular vote and Obama got 61.7 percent of the Electoral College. As you can see the Electoral College overrided the popular vote which ultimately made him president. Also in \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden\" (Paragraph 22)take Richard Nixon\\'s and Bill Clinton\\'s presidental campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn\\'t have become President of the United States.\\n\\nTo continue on, the Electoral College should stay instead of the popular vote since one region of the United States doesn\\'t have enough power of the Electoral Votes to make a presidental candidate win. Look at \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" Mitt Romney doesn\\'t campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn\\'t bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn\\'t have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidental candidates have to say since they are toss-up states. These swing states literally can \"swing\" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states; California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidental canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can\\'t happen.\\n\\nOn the other hand, according to \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" (Parargraph 14) the Electoral is outdated, irrational, and unfair. In \"The Inefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer key names such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerece all want to get rid of the Electoral College and use the Popular Vote. Look at the presidency that was in 2000 with Al Gore against George W. Bush. Al Gore would have won the election if the election was based on the popular vote. He won the popular vote with over 60%! But unfortunately, he didn\\'t win and lost to George W. Bush since Bush won the Electoral College votes. But some people don\\'t really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the \"winners take all method\" some candidates don\\'t go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn\\'t see the candidates. But the candidates didn\\'t go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn\\'t need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.\\n\\nUltimately, Mr or Ms Senator, the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of the popular vote because you will always have an outcome and one region can\\'t overpower another and make a candidate win the presidental campaign. Yes, as said before many people want to get rid of the Electoral College but it will stay with the United States and move forward with us people.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nA student       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0    ', 'score': '5', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '12020', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",
      "{'inputs.question': 'The use of this advanced technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable from three reasons in the article that the author tells us by reading this article.\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting to think ahead and create something big that no one can do. In paragraph 3, the author says, \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" The 44 muscles can tell how the human is feeling, by seeing how the person is moving. For example, when the person is moving really fast, it means that the person might be angry or aggressive. But when a person is moving slow, it means that the person is sad or depressed.\\n\\nThe author tells in the text, \"We humans perform this same impressive calculation every day.\" But comparing a human mind to a computer is different. A human mind can think that the friend is feeling sad, but the computer can have more than just one idea of how the friend feels. The computer can have more than one idea by scanning the face of the person and calculating how the muscles of the face look. It may seem amazing to try to use the technology.\\n\\nFrom the picture of Mona Lisa, when you just look at it, many ideas would pop up in your head from trying to guess how she\\'s feeling and how she looks. There would be multiple guesses on how her face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says, \"The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.\" Some people might say that she looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture.\\n\\nMoreover, the article gives us a lot of information of the advanced technological computer that constructs a 3-D model, to scan a human face and tell how the person feels emotionally.

      "{'inputs.question': 'In the generation we are living in today cars are a huge part of our everyday lives. Whether it\\'s going to school/work, hanging with friends or anywhere really; people rely on their cars for everything and you never hear anyone talk about walking, biking and taking another way of transportation. It\\'s whole new era with how are society is created and working but it\\'s how we are living, and it seems to be working. Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky all have the same mindset when talking about cars; while each are talking about a different reason to decrease car usage, they all have a common interest in wanting it to be implied or simply like how it is being enforced. So after reading very specific, factual, and information articles I now know the advantages of limiting car usage and that is to save time and businesses, conserve resources, and having a vast decrease in car culture.\\n\\nImagine yourself on a bad morning, you woke you late and you\\'re probably rushing out the door for work, and as a fellow American I would know that there is early morning traffic no matter where you are headed. But if you didn\\'t use a car and maybe walked or rode a bike you could easily get there faster if it was a reasonable distance. \"In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets fo this capital city eerily to devoid of traffic jams\" (Selsky, par 20). This goes to show that when people took other steps to get to work instead of cars that there was no traffic jams. Which means no waitng which also means getting to work at a normal time, or for some, even on time. When you think about it you know that the roads can be a really busy and hetic place to be if you time it just right, so if you take the extra measure and maybe walk home you can easily make faster time and not just that but it helps the environment. Now another advantage of not using cars is businesses start to flourish. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush- hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" (Selsky, par 28). Since many people have decided not to use their cars they walk or bike and that can lead to going to places near by which would mean they see more of their city than they did in a car. More eyes are to catch businesses and they find themselves walking into a store because they aren\\'t rushed and/or it might just look intersting which is a huge benefit for companies.\\n\\nSecondly, another advantage on limiting car usage would be conserving resources. This is a very major step when it comes to the environment and things like these should be enforced for a greener Earth. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\" (Rosenthal, par 5). This is damaging our Earth and the only to prevent it is to limit your car use. Because how it\\'s happening and how it\\'s polluting our Earth is from the cars tailpipes when it releases the exhaust. Due to this hazardly problem laws are starting to be made to limit the use. Towns and cities have tried to come up with a no-driving day to decrease the use and help the environment, and in many cases it has worked while in some, it hasn\\'t. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\" (Duffer, par 10). In effect to this \\'experiment\\' it is shown that this way of thinking had changed Paris; pollution decreased and congestion in traffic was down and the smog that was being created by cars had stopped the next couple of days. It\\'s unbelievable to know what can happen when you limit yourself.\\n\\nFinally, it is clear that there is a decrease in car culture. There have been recent studies that imply that more Americans aren\\'t driving or just plain out don\\'t want to get their licenses. \"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...\" (Rosenthal, par 41). We aren\\'t really understanding as to why this is happening. Maybe it\\'s because they are afraid of getting a ticket, their parents haven\\'t allowed it, they are against pollution- it\\'s not known. But what we do know is that yes, it\\'s saving the environment but it\\'s hurting the car businesses. \"If the pattern presists- and many sociologists believe it will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emission, just behind power plants\" (Rosenthal, par 34). Yes, this is going to increasingly better our enivornment by not having more cars on the road to pollute, but it will for sure hurt the car industry. Not many people even have the money to go out a buy a car in this economy. And from the car businesses in ruins, some are even rebranding themselves. The change in car culture is known for much less commuting due to technology as well.\\n\\nLastly, a reminder of the advantages in limiting car usage are saving time and businesses, conserving resources and a decrease in car culture. So when you\\'re on the road, start thinking about ways to stop your use of cars and see how it would benefit the environment; cause the more we drive around the worse our Earth will become.\\xa0    ', 'score': '5', 'gpt_coherence_x': '', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '12046', 'gpt_coherence_y': '3.0', 'gpt_relevance': '', 'gpt_groundedness': ''}\n",

Basically all voters are involved because if it wasnt for that one voter the president wouldnt had been elected as president. A candidate with only one regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. if we didnt have voters we might would have the worst president of them all, he could do bad things for the country he want, which may affect us as a country. Dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College votye is possible is because, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\\n\\nAnother reason, is that the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitutuion .Large states such as florida , wyoming, gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small states does. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote . yet that has happened very rarely. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that is rarely betrayed.\\n\\nin addition, We can have argue that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off the potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for their state . They have to be more careful about who they want to vote because, it can cause alot of damge to the president or even the world that we live in.

Reasons being, if we change too the election by popular vote, citizens are going too choose the president they like, the president that they think will change things, and the president that they think looks best. So of course the citizens are going too choose that particular president just so that president can get the most votes and become president.\\n\\nChanging too the most popular vote will not be the best idea because, citizens are going too choose the president that they like regardless if the president is good or not so good. If us citizens that are voting like the president, then chances are, we\\'re going too vote for him or her. Not only are we going too vote for him or her, were also going to tell our friends too vote for them also so the president can get the most likes and get elected. With the Electoral College, the votes have to go through a process and then the election goes from there.\\n\\nChances being with the most popular election is, we\\'re going too get a not soo good president elected as our president. Most people think that if they choose the \"right\" president, then things are going too change when thats not true. People think that once a new president gets elected that, things around the world are going too change. Yet, when things dont change, they all say \"well, I only her/him for them because he/she looked as if he/she could change things.\" Just because he/she LOOKS like they could change something, doesn\\'t mean its going too happen. That\\'s where the saying \"don\\'t judge a book by its cover\" comes in.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard many people say \"I voted for such and such as president because he/she looks best.\" In an election for president, looks do not matter what so ever. The president could be handsome or gorgeous and be the worst president in the United States and/or the president could be ugly and be the best president. In a president election, no one is going too care about the looks of the president. We\\'re going too care about the person being voted for president, outlook on things as being the president. A lot comes with being a president and the looks surely aren\\'t one of the things. In my personal opinion, if you\\'re voting for the looks, then maybe you shouldnt be voting at all.\\n\\nThere\\'s many reasons on why we shouldnt change too the most popular vote election and why we should just stay with the Electoral College. The most popular vote election would not be the smartest idea of voting for president and honestly, in my opinion, I feel as if the Electoral College is best. Who would want a president being president because they got the most votes for being liked, voted because their the right president, or voted because they look the best?

      "{'inputs.question': 'There has been a huge argument about driverless cars on whether to make them and actually continue with it or not. According to the article \"Driverless cars are coming\", ideas involving driverless cars have been thought of since the 1950s, but the cars have not been fully completed. For that reason, driverless cars should not continue to be developed. Having a car that does the same things you could kind of defeats the purpose of you being in the car at all, there is no point. The cars can be extremely dangerous. If you want to be safe, that means giving up things you might think you want.\\n\\nDriverless cars should not continue being developed because there really is no point in have a car that can do all of the things you are able to do. It is said that driverless cars can operate fully on their own until certain times require otherwise, \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires\" (paragraph 7). These cars can basically be categorized as kind of useless. Why have a car that will basically only drive straight until needing to turn? If there is ever a real driverless car created, it should meet all of the basic requirement such as knowing how to turn properly.\\n\\nAnother reason why driverless cars should no longer be created is because they could go horribly wrong while someone is driving. While driving, the driver will want to be able to rely on a car that will take them where they need to go. Driverless cars could be deemed unable to do this. While someone is driving, they do not want their car to break down nor do they want it to explode or anything like the other new devices coming out. There are others also agree, \"Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states ist is illegal even to test computer-driven cars\" (paragraph 9). Some states believe that by putting customers in the seats of these cars, they are putting them in serious danger. This is why some states have these driverlsess cars banned and illegal. If possible and badly wanted, everyone should follow along.\\n\\nDriverless cars might seem very nice until serious things end up happening. They might allow the driver to take a break from driving, let the driver relax and see things without just driving for a long period of time, but they will not guarantee ones safety. If safety is wanted by everyone then driverless cars should be given up on. Also, maybe people actually like driving, they would not want to give up the amazing opprotunity of driving to a computer when they can do it themselves. Driverless cars should wait to be given to the public until fully complete.

      "{'inputs.question': 'The cities of Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; and Bogota, Colombia all have something in common. They have all taken measures to use cars minimally for at least a small period of time. The results of car use are pollution and accidents among other large scale issues. The cities previously mentioned, however, have taken active roles in preventing these issues. It is no guess as to why the pollution is created; \"...transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions...\" states Elisabeth Rosenthal of the\\n\\nNew York Times . A seemingly simple, but effective, idea could prevent the pollution caused by cars - limiting car usage. Cars have been a major cause of stress with people who always rush to arrive at their destinations, and social interaction (in person) has significantly shot onto the negative end of the spectrum because of the invention of cars. By limiting car usage, the overly tense and smogged communities alike would benefit.\\n\\nA frustrated, tense driver is not an uncommon occurrence. The term \"road rage\" was not spontaneously thought of. The purpose of cars is to transport someone or something from destination \"A\" to destination \"B\" in a short amount of time. This makes the very nature of cars one of urgency and with urgency comes stress. Stressed drivers have been the cause of many a car accident. All it takes is someone who is almost late for a meeting to speed too quickly for an accident to occur. Cutting down on car usage would exponentially decrease the number of car accidents, and it is likely to increase the overall happiness of a community that harbors less cars on their streets. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\" states Heidrun Walter of Vauban, Germany. The community of Vauban has given up their cars. In fact, there are only two places to park there; the parking garage requires a $40,000 fee to reserve a space, and it is rare to find a private garage for a home. Vauban is an example of what is likely the beginning of more communities based on minimal car use. \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,\" states David Goldberg, official of Transportation of America. \"In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \\'car reduced\\' communities...\" (Elisabeth Rosenthal) Communities are realizing the benefits of reduced usage.\\n\\nAn astounding statistic: \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" (Elisabeth Rosenthal) Pollution is the main concern for the generation of fossil fuel consumers. It is not unknown that cars cause pollution because of the diesel and gasoline that fuels the car. The pollution cars bring will not cease to multiply until cars are used less, and hybrid cars are not necessarily the answer because there has always been controversy on whether people will actually buy them with time. Cities who ban car usage see significant changes in the quality of their atmosphere and an example of this is Paris. Paris, the travel destination of both adventurers and lovers, experiences some of the worst pollution - even when compared to Beijing, China. \"Congestion (car traffic) was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog... [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,\" stated Robert Duffer of the\\n\\nChicago Tribune . Paris benefited from the bans and reduced the amount of smog in the city. Paris took action on their car usage issue and it would be beneficial for other places to follow suit as pollution is an increasinly major environmental issue and health hazard.\\n\\nNot only would pollution be shifting downward, but city projects would improve with the limited use of automobiles. Cars promote the improvement of highways and roads. This creates a situation in which the city funds the roads, but fails to focus on other important city structures such as sidewalks and local stores. Roads are constantly run down and massive amounts of tax money go into repairing them, but limiting car usage would prevent road damage and change the city\\'s view on other structures. Bogota, Columbia has a \"Day without Cars\" to \"...promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,\" states Andrew Selsky of\\n\\nSeattle Times . With just one day reserved for not using cars, \"...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks;...; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" (Andrew Selsky) Reducing car use enhances the experience of those who normally don\\'t use cars because of improved bike paths, sidewalks, and is the foundation for a more lively city community.\\n\\nLuckily, the United States seems to already be on the path to lowering numbers of cars used. \"...Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by,\" states Elisabeth Rosenthal from\\n\\n\"\\n\\nThe End of Car Culture\\n\\n\"\\n\\n. America is one of the biggest mascots of the car industry; they have always been on top of advertisement and \\'showing off cars\\' with companies such as Ford and Mercedes. The decline of car usage is beneficial in America for the environment as emissions will be lowered, but the car companies would need to find a different tactic to generate or maintain money flow. The resulting effect is that not only would limiting car usage aid the environment, decrease stress levels, and promote structural integrity of a city, but it would be the dawn of a new cultural age based on a community that has a better transportation system to \"...conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety,\" as proposed by Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Limiting car usage will usher in a healthier age for the younger generations.

In my opinion, although this coding system is brilliant, there is not a need for it in the classroom.\\n\\nThe fact that I live in a time where computers could calculate my mood and or my emotions is nothing short of amazing. But, this coding system doesnt benefit the consumer at all. In paragraph six, D\\'Alto gives an example of a computer analyzing your mood as you come across an ad.

If a student is becoming confused about a certain topic they should raise their hand and ask a teacher (even online run courses always ave a teacher there to supervise). They should seek out a teacher guidance because, at least in my school district. cirriculum cannot be altered.\\n\\nMy district is made up of is five different highschools. All five teach the same exact math, english, and science curriculum. So, the computer would not even be permitted to change my lesson even if I was confused. So whats so helpful about a notification appearing on my screen saying thay I am about 63% confused? the answer is simply, its not.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although this software sounds very talented in what it is capable of achieving, is not useful in the classroom. This specific technology would quite honeslty serve me and my fellow classmates no use at all. What this software can do is what almost any human can achieve with sight and cognitive skills. Give me valuable software that will give me alternate youtube videos or websites to hellp me if im confused not software that just tells me im confused.

When it comes to your safety and peace at mind you should make careful decisons of what potential danger you might be putting yourself in, especially when others are involved. When it comes to driverless cars I stand on the opposing side. I don\\'t think driverless cars are a good idea because they can be costly, dangerous, and give people the impression that you don\\'t need to know how to drive.\\n\\nThese smart cars can be very costly when you think about it. Driverless vehicles are new to the world, with new technology come new bugs and manufactoring errors. For example, one day you could be \"driving\" down the street and one of your sensors don\\'t go off and you run into something. Thats money out of your pocket to fix the damage of your car and whatever or whoever you hit. Depending on how bad it is it can even cost you a lawsuit and medical expences. Even if they do find a bug in your car you\\'re still expected to pay for a replacement and whatever you hit.\\n\\nSmart cars can also be very dangerous. It is mentioned that there are several occassions where human service is needed in case of work zones and around car accidents. In the event that you might not be paying attention you could potentially run into a work zone or car accident. These are only two things but these two things can still be dangerous and even life threatining under certain circumstances.\\n\\nLast but not least driverless cars can put new drivers under the impression that you don\\'t neccissarily need to know how to drive. This is putting other drivers at risk as well. Teenagers and adults with driving permits that try to drive the car will think they don\\'t need to be as aware as they would in a regualr car. Without that sense of alertness in case of an accident or malfunction a person might not know what to do or how to operate the car.\\n\\nOverall I think that it is a bad idea to have driverless cars because they can be costly, dangerous, and give new drivers the impression that they don\\'t need to know how to drive.

      "{'inputs.question': \"Having the opportunity to go to Venus and explore would amazing for humans and scientists on Earth. It would give us the ability to learn more about the planets that are around us and why we are the only planet that humans are able to live it. It gives us insight on different planets and we can learn more about their climate, what the rock and sediment is made of, and if humans could have possible ever lived there. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers that it presents and the author supports his claim with educational details about how it can benefit humans, scientists, and our future.\\n\\nHaving a human able to go to Venus and be able to examine it, even if it is from a distant, can be very educational and help us succeed with many other projects. It can help us succeed by providing details about that planet and what it is like. Although we have pictures and images, nothing is better than a human being able to go and see it and report back exactly what he/she saw. In paragraph 8 sentence 1 it says how it will not only insight will be gained on the planet iself, but also because human cuiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. By being able to conquer this one task, humans will most likely be able to conquer many more things.\\n\\nThe author also tells us that being able to have a human go to Venus we will be able to learn more about it. All of paragraph 4 talks about why scientists are so interested on going to Venus and learning more about it. We can learn if it once was like Earth and why it has changed. There are many similiar features between Earth and Venus that support the idea that Venus was once like Earth. It is said, paragraph 4 sentence 3, that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and coould have supported various forms of life. Although it says probably, by all the facts and research that scientists have done it is most likely that forms of life have existed on Venus. In Paragraph 3 sentence 6 it lists some of the similiar features on Venus that are also displayed on Earth: volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes.\\n\\nIt is not possible for any form of life to survive on Venus currently because of the climate and what the planet is like. The planet itself is so different from Earth in many different ways: temperature, atmostpherical pressure, carbon dioxide, etc. In paragraph 3 the author described the characteristics of the planet and how that even though there are many dangers that could happened by sending a human to Venus, it could be very beneficial to society and to science. Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure it 90 times greater than on Earth. The atmospherical pressure would be able to crush a submarine, even one that could go to the deepest parts of the ocean (paragrpah 3 sentences 3-4).\\n\\nScientists are working on a way to get humans to be able to go to Venus. Although it would be so beneficial if they were able to land on the planet itself, the climate does not allow that option. There is also sulfuric acid in the atmosphere that would corrode anything that tried to get down to the planet itself. Scientists have thought of many different things to try to get a human to Venus, but they have not tried any out yet. There was an idea of having humans in a blimp-like object and floating them above the planet by 30 miles. Although they wouldn't be able to get any rock or sediment samples, this would be safer to them than it would be trying to land on the planet itself.\\n\\nIn conculsion, I would like to say that the author did a very good job of supporting his idea that Venus is a worthy persuit despite the possible dangers. He provided enough information to make it relateable to Earth and he also explained why it would be beneficial to humans and to scientists. He explained how this would be a good opportunity to explore our neighboring planet and learn more about, not just planets themselves, but also but the rest of creation and why Earth is the only possible planet to live on and be comfortable in. \", 'score': '4', 'gpt_coherence_x': '5.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '12607', 'gpt_coherence_y': '4.0', 'gpt_relevance': '5.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",

      "{'inputs.question': \"Certainly there are many different opinions about the Face found on Mars. Some people believe the Face was made by aliens, while other people believe it is a natural landform. I strongly believe that the Face is a natural landform because there is scientific evidence to prove that a landform could be formed on Mars and there are similar landforms like the Face on Earth.\\n\\nFirst of all, there is scientific evidence that proves landforms can form on Mars.\\n\\nFor example, scientists have found that mountains, canals, and volcanoes have formed on Mars. Scientists have also found that Mars, like Earth, has tectonic plates. Tectonic plates cause many different landforms to form when they shift and move around. If tectonic plates create landforms on Earth that no human can, it should be reasonable to think that tectonic plates can be the cause of landforms on Mars.\\n\\nSecondly, Mars has similar landforms to the landforms on Earth. Just like Earth, Mars has volcanoes, mountains, and canals. Scientist have found that tectonic plates are the cause of many of the landforms we see on Earth today. For example, mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide and push against each other, trying to push the opposing plate underneath. If none of the plates budge, the plates will begin to push each other up tho form mountains. For canals to form, water would have to run over the land for a while and erode the rocks until a ditch forms. Even though there isn't water on Mars now, scientist have proved that water has once been on Mars. Since water and tectonic plates cause landforms on Earth, the same elements must cause landforms on Mars as well.\\n\\nEven though I believe that the Face is a natural landform, many other people will disagree with that statement. Many people with opposing viewpoints from mine will say that aliens built the face. Firstly, there is no scientific evidence to even prove the existence of aliens. Secondly, the pictures from the space crafts show no sign of any civilization near by the Face. On Earth, we may have ancient Pyramids that weren't formed naturally, but there were civilizations around those pyramids. Around the Face on Mars there is no sign of any villages or aliens living there. With a Bird-eye view, the face does't seem to have any human facial features. Only when there is a shadow, the features of a human being appear. This makes the Face seem like it was just a coincidence that it had terestrial features. With the lack of evidence to support the claim that aliens made the Face on Mars, it is hard to believe that such an idea could be true.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because there are landforms on Earth that are the same as those on Mars and those landforms were made from tectonic plates and water.

The only thing a city like Miami is missing at night is a sky full of bright stars, which that can be done by people not driving to everywhere they go, even if it is one or two blocks away. This whole \"car-free\" thing is become more and more popular all over the world.\\n\\nIn Vauban, Germany a small town, home to 5,500 people have decided to go car-free. \"As a result, 70 percent of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here\" (Source 1). 70 percent of the the people is a lot, these streets are completly car-free except in the main thoroughfare and on the edge of the community, if this were to happen to a larger city the nights would be beatiful, and so will the days because you have all the car noise out and instead you have people talking and kids running all around the streets. \"Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\" (Souce 1). Miami is a car-intensive area, I know this from personal experince, there is always traffic during the day. I\\'ve been to other places in Florida, not that far from Miami, in Palm Beach at night the amount of starts you see at nights is beautiful and it\\'s something new to see other than in Miami you see 2 to 3 stars. My point here isn\\'t stars, it\\'s how much better the world can be if we all do what this small town in Germany is doing.\\n\\nParis, France. The city of lights home to millions of residents and a landmark for millions of tourists, one would think this city couldn\\'t run without cars, but they made it happen. Paris wanted to clean all the air polution in their city, \"On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)\" (Source 2). Even though some didn\\'t listen and about 4,000 drivers were fined, that is still very little compared to the entire population of Paris. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog\" (Source 2). Can you believe that? Traffic was down by 60 perfect in the city of lights, if it can happen there it can happen all around the world, little by little bu we\\'ll get it. Public transportation was free of charge in the city while this car-free thing was going on. One week later the smog had cleared out enough for the ruiling French party to rescind the ban.\\n\\n\"BOGOTA, Colombia - In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams\" (Source 3). Yes, the city of Bogota in Colombia had its one car-free day, in Bogota called \"Day Without Cars\", this was the third year actually, on this \"car-free\" day cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. Bogota was not the only Colombian city to participate in this event, other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupr, participated in this event for the first time. I find it funny and ironic because my sister has a friend who is Colombian and she owns a bicycle and she goes everywhere in that bicycle, and she refuses to get a car. Bogota is a very known city and just like I said before, if they can do it then the whole world can it. This day should be world wide and should be done at leats twice a year. Events like this will also get people motivated to start walking morre often. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" (Source 3). If you\\'ve ever been to Miami, you know the huge amount of building there are here and I think there are about 3 or 4 being built at I type, how about we stop there and make Miami and healthier and more environmentally friendly place.\\n\\nIn the United States, research shows \"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009\" (Source 4). This meaning that adolescents aren\\'t as intresting and driving as they were before, yeah I see how driving can be better but most kids here take the bus, they aren\\'t even driven by their parents anymore. I find that this is a good thing because, one can ask themselves, I can\\'t make a difference, but if thousands of people ask themselves that, then yes a difference can be made. In 2005 the miles driven by Americans peaked, and then steadily went dropping, in April, 2013 they found out that the miles in car was the same as it was in 1995. Not driving everywhere you go and actually walking there is a good thing because you can make new friends, and health wise it is also good because, instead of walking around your block for an hour, you can walk to someones house or to the store. There are several carpooling apps on the internet nowadays, if your friends can\\'t pick you up, for just a push of a button you can have someone come pick you up to where ever you are and drop you off where you need to go to, for a low price. \"Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by\" (Source 4).

So limiting car usage is really important for the planet and for us.\\n\\nThe less cars we use the less smog there will be in the air.\\n\\nTrying to limit car usage is not a new thing, the day without car is part of an improvement campaing that began in Bogota, Colombia in the mid 1990s (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P27). In Colombia, the rain did not stop the people from participating in the car-free day, and it had an effect in two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, which joined in the car-free day for the first time (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, P25).

I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it has been doing us good for a long time, and if we do change it, it would take a while for us to get used to it.\\n\\nThe first reason why it think that we shouldnt change the Electoral College is because it has been doing us good for almost 300 years. Let me ask you a question, do you change or fix something thats not broken,Than why change the Electoral College. We have had fair Elections in the pass and we still do, people vote for who they want as president of the united states, and if they get the better half of the votes than they are president. As we saw in 2012 when \"Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him\\xa0 and Romney....because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all- basis, even a cery slight popularity in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state\" which is in source 3.\\n\\nThe second reason why I think that we should keep the electoral college is because it would take time for us to get used to the new method. Since we vote every 4 years and if we get a new way to vote there will be a few that wont know how to vote the new way and when it comes for it to vote again people will forget how they voted for the president. So if they vote for the person who they actually dont want its not like they can vote again. But as I said earlier its easy to vote with the Electoral College as its a winner takes all. The electoral vote does have a couple flaws that could be changed easily but in all other ways the elctoral vote is the way to go.\\n\\nAnd thats why I think that we should keep the electoral College because one it hasd been doing us good and it will take us a while to get used to the new voing system.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the polititians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an end to the use of cars on a daily bases. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its\\' streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this \"car-free\" city seem quite content. Germany isn\\'t alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an anti-car revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever growing \"car-free\" city club by starting a program that sponsers a car-free day once a year.\\n\\nTaking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completley inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundancy of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emersed into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its\\' residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the contructions of highways and such. When reading the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation.\\n\\nNext on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnessasary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled \"Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog\" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 14. While Paris officials wanted to completley eradicate driving completley so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completley banned all at once. To help illiminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its\\' citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether or not it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty two euro fine. According to the article titled \"Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog\" by Robert Duffer in paragragh 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illiminated in Paris after that week.\\n\\nAfter Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogota, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completley banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article \"Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogota\" by Andrew Selskey in paragragh 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they\\'re reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s according to the article titled \"Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky in paragrapgh 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogota have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicyce paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city.\\n\\nWithin the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article \"The End Of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable and seem to take more time then to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used and is needed than most people in America seem to take to car-pooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to decrease the amount of air pollution in the country.

I think cars should be driverless because it helps people save money, the cars are safer, and they\\'re modern.\\n\\nDriverless cars help people save money by people not having to buy cars. The passage states in the first paragraph that, \"Google cofounder Sergey Brin, envisions a future with a public transportation system with driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system.\" If people just call the taxi service they won\\'t have the need for a car, so they\\'ll save a bunch of money. With that buses and taxis would use have the fuel they use today, so it could also help with pollution. Also with the taxi system people can be picked up quicker than with taxi services we have today, so people can get to their jobs faster or anywhere.\\n\\nWith driverless cars they\\'re also safer than normal driving cars. The passage mentions an idea of having cameras on the driver to make sure they\\'re alert and paying attention. The car itself has the power to control brake when needed and reduce or increase power from the engine, the car is better at response and control than a human driver alone. There is still the possible mishap of having an accident, but the accident could either be the driver or the car\\'s fault. When the car knows of construction work or too much traffic about to happen the car alerts the driver to start driving, so the car can avoid any accidents happening on its part.\\n\\nThe driverless car is so much more modern than the normal driving car of today. Modernizing cars started in the 1980\\'s, automakers created the antilock brakes and now those have grown to something bigger;the wheels of today detect out-of-control skids or rollovers. The car also tells the driver when to drive for example, GM has developed seats that vibrated to tell the driver to take a hold of the wheel. What\\'s truly so modern about driverless cars is cameras on the rear wheel, rearview mirror, also rotating sensor on the roof, GPS reciever, and inertial motion sensor. All those features are being tested on a Toyota Prius, but the best feature of all is the 3-D model of the surrounding around the car to show the driver what their surroundings are.\\n\\nI\\'m personally for driverless cars because they help save money, they\\'re safer, and they\\'re modern.

In this article we learn about aa new \"Tool\" about face recongition acoording to the new software developed by Thomas Huang a professor at the unniversity of illinois. In the reeading this software claims to be a new sort of \"Da vinci code \" for face recongition. What this new technology does is it recongizes your emotions just by looking into your face, The tool would be able to tell how happy ,sad ,mad etc. you are. They do this by catching the movements of our face muscles to know what is going on in our emotions. Prof. Huang believes that this might be the next huge thing and can help us in our daily lives such as for example-video surgery, video games, classroom computer. The use of this technology for me for students in a classroom me being on in partciular i believe is not the most needed tool or necessary if we\\'re being honest here. In the article it begins to state that we may use this in a classroom. I state that if a child in the classroom has a confusion or question they would ask for themselves that they are having trouble. I think that the facial recongition might be a little to personal for the students for example, They might be having a troubling day and they might get called out for being out of zone just because the facial emotons he portrays. I believe that this computer device software doesnt really have a life changing meaning to it. This might help some people if they want to know how someone feels, We are humans though will a computer really tell someone how were truly feelings inside . I think our eyes are as real or as close as it gets. What do you get having a whole software just to tell you or let you know what you already can see. Technology like this can be cool but if we really want to change the world we need to take charge and make better innovative ideas. What ever happened to verbal communication for others, This will take apart just another piece of communication we have eft towards each other by the way this 21st century is being held, All im saying is that is this tool truly necessary? With that having in mind i can get it predicting how someone can use this for other pruposes as such for video games or computer softwares so they can have a much surreal facial development for them. If we want this all over the US then it will not only be expensive but a waste of time. In the article it was stated that \" Most human communication is non verbal, including emotional communication ,so computers need to understand that too\" we get that we are getting used to so much advancements for us because the use of technology but seriously where does this get us ? us as humnas have such more deeper emotions than \"sad\" \"mad\" thats just surface hitting from what we actually feel and seem to show throughout our faces and body language. This is going to take away from what we can communiate with someone and try to make them feel better ,humans arent computers so we also need to understand that and stop trying to incooperate every single litle thing of technology i our lives when we dont need it despertly. In Conclusion i feel like this article from the perspective of prof.Huang can make me realize how maybe this can help game software development for a more real life like experience, But it doesnt take away how i feel that there is no such than better than our human instict when it comes to these things and we need to have more communications skills if this even becomes an \\' Issue\" rather than ruining it and making this computer read how we \"feel\".

Looking back on that compared to this day and age we have cars that are so close to driving themselves is that the safest idea no, but in my mind i think its a great idea to make self driving cars because everything technology wise is growing rapidly so we cant just leave cars old and boring we need to keep up with the technology we have at this time in our lives and make something new and awarding.\\n\\nSo we all know how many safety concerns we face in cars when on the road and this is exactely why people believe we shouldnt have self driving cars.

We can potentially stop theese problems if we start to live like some parts of Germany; We can live as a car-free city.\\n\\nThe Earth\\'s pollution is mainly caused by cars. Although we probably will not make a law to ban cars completely in the U.S we can potentially start to live like Vauban, Germany. In Vauban, Germany the residents of this community are suburban pioneers. Living on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss border, Vauban\\'s streets are completely \"car free.\" Vauban has only one place to park-large garages at the edge of development, where a car owner can buy a space for about $40,000, along with a home. In result to this 70 percent do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Vauban completed having no cars in 2006 has grown a trend in Europe, the United States and others to take a step back from auto usage. This movement was called the \"smart movement.\"\\n\\nFurthermore the cons from using cars so often is mainly pollution and smog. Due to near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. In result to this prohibition nearly 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. Traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France. After five days of intensifying smog it trailed toward Beijing, China, wich is known as one of the most pollutted cities inthe world. Diesel fuel was to blame for this. France has a tax policy that favor diesel\\xa0 over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent of the average diesel engines n the rest of Western Europe. Sure enough the smog cleared fast enough for the French party to rescind the ban of partial driving.\\n\\nTo add on President Obama\\'s abitious goal to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions will recieve assist from an incipient shift in American behavior. U.S, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had been one of the world\\'s prime car cultures. After decades of being in love with cars America\\'s love affair with vehicles seems to be going down. If this continues, many sociologists believe it will, it will have a beneeficial implication towards carbon emissions and the environment.

Such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are mainly older or buying less cars\\xa0 in one\\'s lifespan rather than rejecting car culture outright.\\n\\nIn conclusion Car usage has made an impact all across the globe.

A close neighbor, Mars, is one of the most famous sci-fi planets of all. Movies, books, etc. have been made based on Mars. Martians or even just plain old aliens have been the tall tale of our time, but could a discovery change the argument between aliens being fake or real. The Face on Mars is a turning point for all people. I am a scientist at NASA who strongly believes that the Face is just a landform on Mars surface because over time the picture quality has gotten better and has made the pictures of the Face come out clearer making it easier to see the definition of the shape.\\n\\nThe first sighting or picture taken of the Face was in 1976. The Viking 1 was circling the planet, snapping photos for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2 when a picture was snapped of what looked like a human face. Regular citizens were shocked at the photo along with scientists. This picture as seen is very blurry. Definition of the landmark is not very clear and with that picture comes many questions; What is this thing? How did it get there? Why is it there? So many questions that no one could answer. So us as humans jumped to the most conclusive answer would could come up with and the answer was that it was made by aliens. NASA quickly turned down the accusation because there was no evidence supporting the idea. In the text the author said, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows how different the picture quality is between 1976 and 2001. Also many people were not satisfied with the picture eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. So on April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking pictures. Thousands of people wanted to see another glimpse of the Face maybe even a better one. The image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. After eighteen years of conspiracy it was proven that the Face was a mesa.\\n\\nIn conclusion the picture from 1998 is how I prove that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture quality has changed dramatically and has put conspiracy theorists in their place. I strongly believe that NASA tried to be on the peoples\\' side, afterall no one really knew what the Face was at first. As we continue on discovering our universe we will surely come across many inccidents like the Face and maybe one day the outcome won\\'t be the same.

In this paragraph it said \"you can probably tell how a friend is feeeling simply by the look on their face\". Some people havr a natural mean look and some have no expression.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Venus is the only planet that is just like earth. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author talks about how scientist are stubying Venus. The author talks about all of the dangers and problems of studying Venus, and why we have to do it. The authors supports his idea that Venus is worth studying even despite the dangers by telling how much people can learn from Venus, how astronomers want to explore venus, and how astronomers have already started workig on getting there.\\n\\nThe first way the author proves that Venus iis worth the danger, is stating how much people can learn from it. People already know information about Venus, and if people go to Venus then they would get so much more information. In the text it said \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.\"(4). Astronomers beleave that there could have once been life on Venus. If astronomers were personaly there in Venus they could search it and stuby it. So much information about Venus could be found, and so many quetions could be answered. Like if Venus had oceans, or lakes, or if it had mountans and animal. Pursuting Venus would not only be informational but it will let astronomers acheave their dreams.\\n\\nAnother reason the author gives is how astronomers want to explore and go to Venus. There is so much information people already know about Venus because astronomres have already did work, and experiments on it. In paragraph 4 the author said \"Astronomres are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\"(4). There are people that want to go learn from Venus, they want to go to find a way and go to Venus. These astronomres don\\'t care about how dangerouse it is, because they are so \"fascinated\" with this planet they can stuby, thats why they are already on their way.\\n\\nThe last reason the author gives is Astronomers have already started. Astronomres have already sent\\n\\nspacecrafts to Venus. In paragraph 5 it said \"For example, some simple electrinics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of venus\\'s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\"(7). Astronomres have made equitmen that mimics Venus\\'s weather. They have already done so much reaserch that they now what is going to happen on Venus and made it happen in a small teast room. Then in paragraph 5 it says \"NASA\\'s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\"(5). They alreadt have more than one solution to the problem, Astronomres are already ignoring the dangers and still moving on with going to Venus.\\n\\nThe auther makes very good points in the test on why people should still pursuit going to study Venus despite the dangers, telling how people can learn, how people want to go, and how Astronomres are already on their way. Going to a new planet is fascinating, and inspiers people. Their not going to turn and run away when faced with a problem, they are going to push on and find a slution.

Mechanical computer\\'s stretches back to the 1800s and that they were later used in the 1940\\'s during World War ll. \"The thought of computer\\'s existing in those days might sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all\" Older computers can actually withstand Venus climate than Brand new computers. Technologies from today can barely last 2 minutes due to the fact that they are delecate and made out of tin. \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many euqually intimidating endeavors.\" This prooves that no one is likely to stop studying Venus until we have collected enough samples.

For example, in 2012 Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This is a desierable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful prsident. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes don\\'t count,that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn\\'t their president.\\n\\nThe winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

In the articel it says it used to be just like Earth in a way. So our natural assumption is to asume that our planet will end up just like Venus. But if we take some time and continue exploring the planet we might find some new information and could possiblly save all of humanity in the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion the option to explore Venus still remains untuched but the positives and possibilities that could come out of this exploration are vast compared to the dangers it represents. \", 'score': '3', 'gpt_coherence_x': '3.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '14631', 'gpt_coherence_y': '5.0', 'gpt_relevance': '5.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",

      "{'inputs.question': 'Body actions say more than words could ever say. This can simply be tested by taking a glance at any individual you may come in-contact with; almost immediately, our brains can process exactly how the other person is feeling. In recent years, this process we do ourselves, has turned to technology. Professor Thomas Huang from the Beckam Institue for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois has worked close by Professor Nicu Seb from the University of Amsterdam, to accomplish creating a computer program that can capture and explain human emotions. After some time, this work in progress became a reality, and was named the Facial Action Coding System. This invention has sparked interest in many different groups of people and in many varying fields of work. One of these fields is education. The Facial Action Coding System can positvely be used in the classroom to improve overall student experience by effectively and accurately catching a glimpse of their nonverbal communication in hopes to result in lesson plan alterations and opening prime opportunities for vulnerability in teacher to student relationships.\\n\\nThis new technology advancement has been found to provide very accurate results based on anatomy; therefore, would be sucessful no matter where it was used. Creator, Dr. Huang, definitely did his research when creating the Facial Action Coding System. The text reads, \"Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisley enough to convery specific emotions.\" Based on this information, it is easy to see that our body language, and simple expressions are simply coded in our human anatomy; Da Vinci knew it and now so do many others. All of the human muscles work together to deliver our innermost feelings and thoughts. The text reads, Eckman has classified six basic emotions -- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness -- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\" This information is essentially the way in which the Facial Action Coding System calculates human emotions in hopes to cause other people to potentially act differently. All humans use the same facial muscles, so this product can be effective on anyone.\\n\\nDr. Huang says, \"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal...the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).\" This piece of text is important to comprehend in order to fully understand the capabilities of the Facial Action Coding System. By using this structured and prepared system the results relayed back to an individual are extremely accurate. As a result of this accuracy, not only could the product be used anywhere; one of the most effective uses would lie in the classroom. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System uses a sytematic process to determine any individual across the world\\'s emotions; which is an important piece of evidence because many individuals may not believe its\\' accuracy.\\n\\nThe Facial Action Coding System can effectively used in the classroom to adjust lesson plans based on student preference. One aspect, Dr. Huang mentions is the prevelance of nonverbal communication; especially for young children who are in the education system. He says, \"Most human communication is nonverbal, includimg emotional communication.\" This quote is significant when in the context of the Facial Action Coding System. Within the walls of a classroom this computer program could be used to dig deeper into a students emotions and feelings in order to understand them better and adjust to specific needs. For example, after using this program on a group of kids in the classroom; red flags may appear that gear toward frustration, stress, or confusion and this would give way for a teacher to step in and make a difference. If a large group of students were confused, the teacher would then know they may need to review the topic more thouroughly or by taking an alternate approach. If the computer system can reveal that a student is frustrated, the teacher would be able to console them positively in hopes they would be willing to take part in extra help or practice wihtin a subject. Dr. Huang also mentions, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student in becoming confused or bored.\" As previously mentioned, by using the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher will be informed of the emotions and feelings of their students that they are unwilling to first hand share with an adult. Overall, this computer program would offer many positive advancements to the classroom that help teachers better prepare for individual student needs and preferences.\\n\\nAs the Facial Action Coding System could contribute to a teacher\\'s knowledge of student reaction in the classroom, it could also make the classroom a much happier place by opening up chances for vulnerability and positive emotions. As previously stated, as a teacher becomes more aware of his or her students\\' emotions and takes practical steps towards fulfilling their individual needs; a door to vulnerability is quickly opened. Within the walls of a classroom, the relationship between a teacher and student is very important and can make or break a students learning for a short span of time. If the Facial Action Coding System was able to spot a negative emotion, and enable the teacher to step in and help the student walk through that struggle; vulnerability happens in the classroom and can make it a much better place to be. In additon the text reads, \"According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.\" As the FACS enters into classroom usage, many students will become more aware of emotions they may be unable to verbalize. With this knowledge they may be able to better combat their negative body language and work on recognizing when their emotions may be going down a wrong path and be able to change it quickly. Just as that quote said, making a specific emotion may allow the individual to rapidly improve. Overall, the usage of FACS in the classroom would allow for students to have much more realistic and intentional relationships with their teachers and improve their emotions everyday.\\n\\nAll in all, the Facial Action Codign System is a computer system created that could have many important usages in the future. However, one of the most essential would be within the walls of a classroom. This opportunity would open many positive chances for emotions to be relayed accurately to a teacher in hopes that they would be able to alter lesson plans and change other aspects of their teaching style to better suit individual student needs. In addition, other studies and research completed with the FACS shows that this system can and will relay accurate results because body language is universal and our human anatomy does not lie. Lastly, allowing students to better understand their emotions will help them react to them before they may get out of hand. With early detection and acknowledgement of negative emotions the classroom could become a much happier place to be. This system is going to change the way many programs work, but mostly within the classroom. Teens emotions are always changing, body actions always say more than words could ever.

These driverless cars they are making are controlled by a computer. What would people with driverless cars do if the computer controlling their car just crashed , or stopped working. These cars could put someone in danger all because they have no control over it.\\n\\nIn the text they talk about how the more smarter cars needed a lot of sensors for the startes to work.

      "{'inputs.question': 'Is the face on Mars the face of a new discovery in our universe? When a face was discovered on Mars, the idea of it was quite controversial. Generally speaking, the face on Mars was just a pop icon, not a sign of life. The face on Mars was proven to be a simple landform because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to determine, there were no signs of any civilization, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. The Face on Mars was just a pop icon and a skeptic\\'s thought, not a sign of martian life or civilization.\\n\\nFirst of all, in 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to find evidence, when all they found was a natural landform.\\n\\nThe Red Planet was very cloudy that time of year, and theorists believed that the haze was hiding any martian evidence or civilization. However, it is not easy to target Cydonia, because of Mars\\' natural orbit and the fog and haze Mars receives every so often. So, in 2001, NASA sent the Surveyor back up to Mars to take pictures and investigate.\\n\\nWhen the photos were taken, the photos were discerned three times bigger than the pixel size, and no signs of civilization appeared. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA\\'s Mars Exploration Program states. Each pixel in the image taken was around 2 meters, when the Viking image taken in 1976 had fourty-three meters per pixel. In 1976, the theories could have been believable, considering that the images taken did not show very much evidence if any.\\n\\nFinally, the American West was compared to Mars when the \"Face\" was labeled as a butte or a mesa. The American West is sultry, gusty, and somewhat similar to what the environment on Mars is. This environment is the perfect environment to form buttes, due to erosion in the soil and the wind pushing the soil around. The landmass on Mars is not exactly a butte, however. This landmass is the Martian equivalent to what the American West has. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That\\'s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,\" says Garvin.\\n\\n\"There hasn\\'t been enough evidence of the Face on Mars to prove it\\'s only a landmass!\" There has been several images taken of the Face to prove it is a formation. However, the image taken in 2001 is the most accurate, considering that the pixels are about two meters by two meters. That is about 22 times more accurate than the picture taken in 1976, showing about fourty-three meters each pixel of Cydonia. If there were any evidence to show up on the Face, it would be shown in the 2001 image.\\n\\nThe Face on Mars is only a martian mesa, not a pop icon or a civilization. It is an extraterrestrial butte because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to prove, there were no signs of any civilization when images were taken, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. All in all, the Face on Mars wasn\\'t a sign of out-of-this-world autotrophs, but it was just a simple bizarre-shaped butte.

      "{'inputs.question': 'I do not think that the use of this technology in a classroom is valuable. I think the use of this technology is pointless and a waste of money, in a classroom atleast.\\n\\nOne reason I do not agree with the use of this computer software in a classroom is because the software doesn\\'t understand everything that we are feeling inside. People don\\'t always put on a face when they are feeling some type of emotion, rather they can just sit there expressionless and still feel angry, sad, or happy. I do not think this software is advanced or accurate enough to tell what we\\'re feeling.\\n\\nAnother reason I find this software useless in a classroom is about learning cirriculum in the classroom. In the article it said that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\". How is the software supposed to know what we are learning, how we are supposed to learn about it, and how would the software modify the lesson to make it less confusing or more interesting? I think the software would be less useful than an actual human being teacher, because a teacher can explain and help you with something when you\\'re confused, and not have to worry about modifying the lesson which could cause everyone to be at a different level of understanind of the lesson.\\n\\nMy final reason I do not agree with the use of this technology in a classroom is about the cost, and is it even nessasary? Since this software is new and advanced for facial coding, I would assume it would be very expensive. The use of this system to me, is just a waste of money, and is basically making teachers less useful and interactive with their students. A teacher is the one who should make decisions on how to teach a lesson or how to help a student, rather than a computer software that doesn\\'t know what a person is thinking just because of their facial expression.\\n\\nIn conclusion I do not agree with using this technology in a classroom to help students with their learning. This software may be useful in other situations, but to me, in a classroom it is useless along with a waste of the schools money.

If anything does go wrong with the car and if it hurts someone or even kill someone, manufactures will be blamed for the accident. The people wouldnt be able to trust the company anymore and the company will start to lose money beacuse people would stop buying their cars.\\n\\nDeveloping these types of cars sound very cool, but the safety of these self-driven cars is a big concern. No one would want to take the risk of any problems with the car that could lead to their death. In paragarph 9 in the article it says \" if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?\" the manufacturer should be responible if anything goes wrong. They should be responsible because they made the car and after one injury they should just stop the company of making more because they will continue to hurt people will their product. Somethign could go wrong with the car without alerting the driver and it could go out of control without anyway to stop the car.\\n\\nHuman drivers should have 100% control of their car, because if anything goes wrong it will be against the driver not the car. people trust them selfs better than the car. Some cars cant even handle driving their selfs on their own in some tasks and what if it doesnt alert the driver to take over, this could seriously lead to big accident.\\n\\nIf an accident does happen everything will be blamed against the company. The company will have charges agaisnt them. The company will be force to shut down before another accident can occur. The cars will be seen unsafe to drive, this will give a reason to the people not to buy these types of cars. If people stop buying self-driven cars the company will go bankrupt and everything will go to waste.\\n\\nIf new technology is taking over like cars, no one will know how to fix the car without help of the manufacters who knows what is going on. people wouldnt want to be charged just for them to check on the car and to know whats going on.\\n\\nThis is why I think this is a bad idea.

Now in Germany they are making cities where they help banned car usage. In the romantic city of Paris,France they are now starting to banned cars due to the overload of smog. The city of Bogota,Colobia is having a special day where they banned cars and see the effect of now having cars for a day. The car usage is now being observed to do damage around the world and due to that now cities all over the world is now banning the car usage. This will help to have a healthier earth and healthier people. The benefits of banning cars is going to help everyone and even our beloved earth.\\n\\nIn Germany the people have made a city where they have given up their cars. The city I believe has a better way to maintain a healty and cleanier enviroment than other cities in Germany. The banning of cars has been a great sucess with now people using bikes or walking as their means of transportation. Even though car ownership is permitted,the problem is that there are only two places to park which cost about 40,000 dollars along with your home. The result of that actions is that 70 percent of people do not own a car and 57 percent sold the car to live in the city. One person states \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" says Heidrun Walter. The citizens of this city have been feeling better about having no car you dont have the stress to have to drive you have the calm relaxing time by walking or biking. did you know that \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 perecent in car intensive areas in the United States.\"The greenhouse gas has been a problem ever since the development of motor power cars. Now that we are able to stop it lets take that chance to help stop the greenhouse gas and to make cleaner and healthier cities.\\n\\nThe romantic city of paris is having a bit of a problem its that its beautiful city is now being coveres in smog due to the overuse of cars. now that Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to help clear the air they can\\'t help to notice that when there are fewer cars being operated the smog begins to clear up. The smog has always been a problem for Paris it usually has more smog than in any European country. The article states that \"Paris has 147 micrograms of perticulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,Reuters found.\" The romantic city of Paris cant be as wonderful if it always has a problem with having too much smog I believ that the cars are the ones to blame for this matter that if the city of paris bans its cars that the smog will decrease and become a the romantic city that it is. The article states that \"diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe.\" That means that it is in fact the motor cars that are the ones causeing the overflow of the smog. If the the cars are able to to be banned in paris we will see a drop in the smog and Paris will return to the romantic city that it is.\\n\\nThe city of Bogota,Colombia has been celebrating the day without cars for over three years straight. The car free day help leave the streets of the capital city without any traffic jams. One problem of the road that many countries have in their capital city is that they have to many cars because of the tourist and the huge number of people who live there which causes traffic jams leaving cars in the streets for hours on end. They have the same problem in Brazil where they have one of the worlds worst traffic jams in history. The ones who delevoped the car free day was trying to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Someone states in the article \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The stress of having a car in a countries capital can be stressful to some people and that bikeing or walking is a way to help calm someone after a busy day at work. Due to the car free day the city states that \"uneven, pitted side walks have been replaced by broad,smooth sidewalks, rush hour restirictions have dramatically cut traffic.\"The car free day i feel is benefitting everyone from getting rid of traffic jams to clearing up the smog. The replacing of cars for bikes and walking is not so much a bad idea if it will help benefit evryone around you.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the car culture is now coming to its end. That nations all over the world has seen the great benefits from banning cars. The greatest effects that banning cars has is that they are helping to get rid of air pollution,stress,and the grreenhouse gas. These are all benfits for everyone it helps the ither people beside u and the environment. The romantic city of Paris was covered in smog due to cars. In Germany where they have developed a city where there is no car in sight and has everything within a walking or bike distance. The city of Bogota,Colombia making a holiday that has been going on for three years straight to have no cars for a day.

Think of it this way; you vote for a specific candidate, but you are voting without knowing entirely whether or not your votes are making a difference because you have no control over who the electors vote for. I believe this system should make modifications.\\n\\nOur county has already had many problems, and accusations of having a corrupt government. Hearing about the electoral college system, and the fact that as a nation we have almost no power for who is elected, does not help the case of being called \"corrupt\" or \"incorrect\". The people as a whole in the United States should be able to vote for the candidate of their choice, without worries. People who specifically vote for someone running for president should either be able to do it themselves, without having to vote for a slate of electors, or, the slate of electors should be more reliable. As in paragraph ten, we cannot always control who the elecotrs cast their vote for. \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.\" Either the electors need to be more reliable in carrying out the requests made by the people of the United States, or we must make modifications to possible change or all together cease use of the electoral college system.\\n\\nIn addition to the fact the American people do not hace full control over who our electors vote for, we do not even have control over who our electors are.\\n\\nIn paragraph eleven, it states that \"legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" If you were truly in favor of protecting the rights given to the people of this country, you would notice this system is wrong. No control over our votes, and no control over the electors? Something must change.\\n\\nTake into consideration how our country is affected every time a new president is elected. Sometimes this effect is good, others not so much. The popular vote should be able to decide who is elected for president because those who are voting will be effected greatly by the change in presidency. Popular vote means the vote cast the most, the vote submitted most, the vote a large majority presented. The popular vote is always at risk of being defied, and there is nothing the common people of the United States can do about it. There is no action we can take to change the election.

What if the trust is betrayed sometimes without our knowledge?\\n\\nFinally, unless I have not made it entirely clear, I am not in favor of the electoral college system.

      "{'inputs.question': 'In my opinion I think driverless cars are a bad idea. I think they are inconvinent. I believe that bad things could happen if there were driverless cars, such as accidents and or death itself. Lastly, I believe that malfunctions can and will happen in driverlss cars. In this essay I will explain why I think driverless cars are a bad idea for more then one reason.\\n\\nTo start off with, driverless cars are not completely driverless as of right now. Therefore they are very in convinent because they cannot go through work sites or traffic areas, where most people wouldn\\'t want to drive through. Details taken from the passage are \"...Google cars aren\\'t truly driverless; they still alret the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents.\"\\n\\nIn my experience I find driving through work cites to be a little scary because you have to maintain a slow speed and make sure you do not hit anything or injure anyone. With workers on the road it makes it scary as well because accidents can happen, but you never want them to occur. In my opinion this is a huge inconvience for people who get nervous driving through these areas.\\n\\nSecondly, I believe that bad things could occur from driverless cars, such as malfunctions causing a car to maybe stop working with you inside it would possibly the car losing control of itself and you being injure because of this. They have driverless cars right now that are not completely driverless and you have to drive for certain parts of the road, but what if this dosn\\'t work and the car continues to drive through a work cite with a speed limit of 20 mph going a speed of 50 mph? Someone would end up getting hurt and you would end up with a big fine or jail time. Taken from the text itself, \"...new laws willbe needed in order to cover liability in the case of an ccident. I fhte technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?\" This means that if something bad happens no one knows who wil be blamed.\\n\\nNext, cars can malfunction adn there have been recalls in the past because of things that have gone wrong. For example brakes not working causing a death toll. What car brand wants someone to look at their cars and then see a death toll due to the fact that the car companies brakes didn\\'t do their job and a person couldn\\'t stop? Driverless cars have many sensors. AS started from the text, \"For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors.\" Sensors and almost anything else can malfunction for no reason at all. Because of how many sensors would be in a completely driverless car there is no way to insure that every sensor will work properly and make sure no mistakes will be made.\\n\\nSome people may say that times are changing and technology is at an all time high and they would be correct, however I do not believe that driverless cars are the future. I believe that they are dangerous and could do more harm then good. That is why in my opinion driverless cars are a bad idea for more then one reason.

Many cities, such as Vauban in Germany, have given up on using cars to help the world around them. \"Vauban\\'s streets are completely car-free,\\xa0except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community.\" There is a movement going on called, \"smart planning\" and Vauban is just one example of a growing trend in Europe of limiting auto use. The article says that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. It seems that the people in Europe are realzing that so much car usage is harming their environment, and they are trying to set a trend for other countries like the United States to follow to limit using cars.\\n\\nHow much people use their cars is very important. Polluted air is a very widespread problem in many regions of the world. Paris had days of near-record pollution, and decided to enfore a partial driving ban to try to help clear the air of the city. The article says that almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and twenty-seven had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog.\" The driving ban helped clear the smog, because it reduced car emissions. Paris has more smog than many other European capitals, which is why reducing how much citizens drive their cars is a good idea.\\n\\nSome cities have days that are completely car free. Bogota, Colombia is one of them. They have been having a Day Without Cars for three straight years. Cars are banned for the day and buses and taxis are the only exception. The city holds about 7 milion people, and had a large turnout. \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay even said that, \"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\" The Day Without Cars has even helped stores and sports center come up throughout the city. Instead of shopping centers along a highway, those stores are now in the city and easy to get to without having to use a car.\\n\\nResearchers have been studying America\\'s ways of car usage and driving. America is home to the first cars like the Model T, or \"Mustang Sally.\" Vehichles have always been a huge part of culture, but it seems now that that might not be the case anymore. \"As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.\" Researchers are actually hoping that the pattern continues because it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions on the environment. Transportation is the second largest source, behind power plants, of emissions. Many changes have now happened in America, which are making using cars not as important. \"With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit..\" The article says. If we could slow down the usage of cars and emission, maybe we could help the planet become a better place.\\n\\nSince the percentage of car usage has gone down in America, so has the percentage of getting a license. There has been a large drop in 16-39 year olds getting a license, Mr. Sivak\\'s research has found. Older people are also likely to retain their licenses as they age. Mr. Sivak and another man both have children of about the same age, 19 and 21, and live in busy cities where a car could be useful. Neither one of them has their licenses, even though they are interested, but they don\\'t really see the need for one when they can use public transportation or car-pool with their friends. The article says that a study last year has also found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

      "{'inputs.question': 'When limiting car usage the first thing that most everyone thinks of is: \"How would I get from Point A to Point B instead of driving myself in my car? Would I walk, ride a bike, take public transportation, or try and find a new creative approach?\" Limiting car usage is not the end of the world, it is the beginning of a healthy one. Most cars burn gas which cause smog and pollution which is harmful to the enviorment, some people get lazy and end up being so dependent on a vehicle that they will not even consider walking a few blocks to a friend\\'s house for an afternoon lunch, and our own ancestors have gone without a car for centuries on end. So would it really be that much of a struggle to not use a car any and every where that you go? You do not need to never use your car again, you just need to realize that using your vehicle more than needed is harming not just yourself, but everything and everyone you interact with in life.\\n\\nIn Paris, France a partial driving ban was put into effect just before the \\'City of Love and Romance\\' reached record breaking pollution levels. The ban states that: \"On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following days.\"(\"Paris bans driving due to smog\", Robert Duffer). However, just because there is a law put into affect does not mean that everyone will abide by it. According to Reuters, an international news agency in London, almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their vehicles impounded because of their reaction to the fines. It is a shame that people are so unwilling to follow one rule for one day which would help the planet and reduce the pollution in their city. According to Duffer, Paris ,typically, has more smog than other European capitals. When Duffer\\'s article was published he states, \"Last week Paris has 147 micrograms of particulate matter(PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.\" Also, in Paris, diesel fuel is used more than gasoline. Diesel engines take more energy to burn the gas which causes more pollution than just normal gasoline. According to Reuters, France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In France, as a whole, 67 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. In the rest of Western Europe, about 53 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. The smog that is in the air from the burning gas of your vehicle ends up in your lungs. Imgine just sitting in front of the exhaust pipe of your car for a few seconds(do not actually attempt this analogy) it is overwhelming and unbearable. It is harmful to your lungs and the rest of your body. That pollution is coming out of thousands and thousands of other cars and is adding up to the air all around you. You breath that air every day, just like your family and friends as well. In Paris, after the partial driving ban, on Monday the smog cleared up enough for the French party to take away the ban on the odd-numbered plates on Tuesday, according to Duffer. If the smog in one of the biggest cities in the world can clear up just a little bit in one day from limiting car usage, imagine how much smog could be prevented if you limit your car usage every day. What if you only used your vehicle when traveling out of town or when you need to transport a large item? You can change your whole enviorment just by deciding to walk or ride the bus to work instead of turning on your vehicle to drive 10 miles down the road.\\n\\nThe law that was put affect in Paris, France does not state that you can never drive your vehicle again, it is just simply asking the citizens to go one day without their vehicle. \"But what if I have to go somewhere such as work, school, or anywhere else that I want?\" Paris is a large city, that much is understood, because it is a large city there is more than just one way of getting from Point A to Point B. One way is public transportation from the city and/or local businesses, like a bus or tram.\\xa0 According to the BBC public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday as well. So, if you did not want to spend extra money than you had to that would not be a probolem. If you do not like public transportation, or do not prefer it, you can get out for a bit of exercise and ride a bike or even walk. Getting up or leaving maybe an hour or two early so that you can get to your desired destination on time is not that heavy of a price to pay. Also, you are getting exercise out of it which benefits your health. Walking or even riding a bike to work can benefit you in so many ways. If you see someone familiar walking towards you, you have the opportunity to start up a conversation and catch up with how their life is going. As well as this, if you see a small shop or stand that sparks your interest you have easier access to explore inside. If you were driving/riding in a vehicle then you would have to cross traffic, find a parking spot, make sure you grabbed everything that you need, and make sure that it is locked. If you are taking a stroll through town, you already have your needed things, you do not need to cross traffic and find a parking spot, and you do not have to risk accidentally leaving your vehicle unlocked and end up possibly getting robbed. A study discovered by Elisabeth Rosenthal found out that driving by youth decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe this is because young people still have the energy and sense of adventure in them to walk or take a bus somewhere(or they just can not afford it, which in the long run saves them money anyway). Maybe you can learn from the young people that decide to ride a bike or skateboard to work instead of driving a car. Maybe taking public transportation is not as crowded and as much of a hassle as the movies make it seem. Taking public transportation can introduce you to new people with different backgrounds as well. You can meet someone that you might not see as a coworker or a family friend that you have an idea already who they are. Some people are always so busy with every day life that they do not have the time to meet new people and learn new names. With public transportation or deciding to walk instead you have a bigger opportunity to meet someone new. Why not give yourself a healthier lifestyle by walking once a week to work instead of driving? The question still remains, why not?\\n\\nLimiting your vehicle usage does not limit your options and exposure to the outside world. Having a vehicle is not entirely a bad thing either. Some vehicles are \\'eco friendly\\' and are built so they can help protect the enviorment. Sadly, however, most are not built and designed that way. Driving is so stressful for a person. You have to focus on all of your surroundings, check every blind spot, make sure that all of your fluids are not empty, replacing tires, and so much more. Again, driving is not all bad. Some people enjoy to drive, some say that is relaxes them and gives them time to think because driving is the only \\'alone time\\' that they have. Carlos Arturo Plaza says, \"It\\'s a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" The human race has survived countless centuries without motor vehicles, why can we not seem to last just a day?

      "{'inputs.question': 'Nowaday, the world of technology is really big all around the world. People start to use technology for everything in their daily life. From their house, their school or work. Phone, laptop, computer, cars, etc. Each day a lot of inventors work hard to produce their invention to make the world better. Recently, iphone company just release a new iphone called iphone X that you can unlock the phone without using your finger, you can just look at the camera and the phone will recognize your face and open it for you. That is a really popular invention that everyone excited to buy and love to use. People create many new technology for it to communicate with humans like iphone X as an example. Thomas Huang professor of University of Illinois collaboration with Nicu Sebe professor of University of Amsterdam created a software called :\"Facial Action Coding System.\" The software were created because Dr. Huang said that he want to develop better ways for huamsn and computers to communicate. The software can recognize humans emotions. Either, you happy, sad, fear or surprise, the computer just look at you and tell what is your feeling right the way. Because Dr. Huang is a professor at University of Illinois, beside the software he just look like every professior that have to go to class and teach. As many people know, not every time you attend the class you understand what the teacher teach you. Sometime you get bored, sometime you get confused or tired. But all of that emotions you are the only one that know about it. With that in mind, Dr. Huang wanted to bring the software to his class so he will know his lesson is actually go through students mind or not. He will know the time to change the topic to make student more productive, more happy and enjoy in his lesson. Not just only him, every teacher in the world need this sofware, everyone want their students to happy to learn. More happy you are, more focus you are in the class. The Facial Action Coding System is a valuable software for school that help teacher recognize students feeling and that can make the class better.\\n\\nHere is how it works. According to the article \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles\" This show that, we can believe in the result of the software after its read the emotions. Because the computer created a model of the face, with all muscles that humans has. When you move your face the 3-D model of the face will form exactly the same as your face to help the software recognize what is that emotion. One of psychologist and creator of FACS that work with Dr. Huang is Dr. Paul Eckman has classified there are six basic emotions :\"happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.\" That is what emtions of a regular humans looks like. Either you happy because you got good grades, or anger because someone ate you ice cream that you save for a long time. They bring every emotions of humans in real life in the software to help help it easily recognize humans face. One of the example from the article is when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you are surprised, or your orbicularis oris (around your moth) tightens your lips to show anger. The computer is really smart, just look to your face and form the 3-D it can easily show how mad you are, how sad you are. Even from the painting Mona Lisa of Leonardo da Vinci, the computer show she\\'s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fear ful and 2 percent angry. You can see how smart it is. If you mad and angry or surprise at the same time, the computer will still know and point of the percent of each emotions. When you make a fake smile, the software still recognize it. According to the article \"But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius.\" You cannot lie to them, they already know exactly how you give them fake or real smile. Go back with Dr. Huang classroom. Why is FACS is a valuable software for study at school? Because when you are tired, bored or mad about something you cannot focus on the lesson or what the teacher or proffessor teach you. From that the computer will recognize your emotions and tell the teacher your feeling. Teacher cannot make you forget about your problems but they will create or find another way to make the class seem more fun or do more activities instead of just standing and read ore teach boring stuff that you don\\'t care about. That\\'s help you feel more comfortable, in that way when you feel happy and relax you can focus on your work more. All of the stuff that you learn will easily come to your brain and you will remember it.\\n\\nThe FACS is a great software for school. It can help teacher/professor a lots in their way of teaching students and from that students will focus more on the teaching time. Not just classroom, this could help many people around the world with whatever they do. Because sometime, humans being never tell anyone about their feeling, they just sad and angry but noone now about it. Using computer to communicate with them is a great ideas. Like an example in the article, when it recognize your emotions and know that you sad, it will find an ad or something funny that can make you laugh right the way. Since many people around the world using technology all the time, people should create more things that could help technology communicate with humans. Because it could help the world more modernized, help the people without family or friends feel better when they communicate with technology. Growth more technology will make the world better.

In today\\'s modern society we have had the technology and the people to make a movie-like fantasy into reality. Google has been working on a car since 2009, that does not need a human operating it one-hundred precent of the time. However, these autonomous casr are not completely driverless. All in all, autonomous cars can help and change our world for the better.\\n\\nAutonomous cars can potentially be safer than humans alone. The dirverless car, with the use of lasers, are so advanced that they can detect and respond to danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. This technology can prevent hundreds of accidents and lives everyday. When the car sensors danger it doesn\\'t immediately slam into the brakes like a human would, potentially causing a problem. Instead, the car applies the breaks while reducing power from the engine, allowing far better control that any human could have by themselves. \"...making driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.\" Another example of how autonomous cars can potentially be safer than humans alone is with the development of the \"Traffic Jam Assistant\". This development allows the driver to obtain control over the car if needed. For example, a work zone or accidnet is ahead, the car notifies the driver ot take over. \"This necesitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs.\" Autonomous cars also may have camereas just to reassure the driver isn\\'t letting the car do all the work. This can help prevent accidents or disaterous situations. If the driver is texting and the car senses a problem, the car will get the drivers attention and thus by-passing any collison or problem. \"While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.\" Autonomous cars can potentially be safer than humans alone.\\n\\nWhile autonomous cars have all these new developments that can prevent many situations, they can also be potentially disaterous. For example, if the car were to malfunction and not brake when it senses danger, it could be extremely dangerous for the human. Today traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. However, there are hundreds or car accidents when humans had full control of the car evryday. With the autonomous car, that rate can potentially drop drastically. An example would be a human is texting and driving, and they dont notice its\\n\\nred light and cause an accident. With autonomus cars the car would alert the human, making them realize. Autonomous cars have many pros and few cons.\\n\\nCars that can drive themselves are no longer movie fanatsies. They are in our real lives, and plan to hit the streets in as early as 2020. With new technologies they can save lives and make our lives easier. Give them a shot and see how autonomous cars can help and change our world for the better.

      "{'inputs.question': 'For most people it is more common to get from place to place by hopping in a car. But, what if we never used cars, or at least limited them? Lives would be inpacted in a very positive way. In\\n\\nIn German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal,\\n\\nParis bans driving due to smog , by Robert Duffer,\\n\\nCar-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata , by Andrew Selsky, and\\n\\nThe End of Car Culture , by Elisabeth Rosenthal the authors show how cars are not a neccesity to life and how our communities can even be better off without them. Because of the positive impact on our enviroment and the increase of a community, limiting car usage is a serious idea worty of a second look.\\n\\nCars, especially in America, are a major source of transportation. Without them many people would not have an easy way to commute to where they need to be. But, convience is causing more pain than pleasure and startign to harm our enviroment. Cars just by themselves cause around fifty percent of the greenhouse gases that are emited into the atmospere. Similarly they cause twelve percent in Europe (par. 5) Logically it would make sense to find the root of a problem and change it to make the problem go away, but in the case of cars, cars are a root in the pollution problem, but many people need them to ge to get where they need to be. The easiest solution to this is to limit our car use and add more busses and easier, more acessable areas for bikes and walking. Pollution will lower and people will still get to where they need to be. Pollution is a major topic regarding the safety of our enviroment and cars have been a proven source of much of the pollution in the air. Using less cars coensides with less pollution in our surroundings. Paris, France was suffering from very high pollution in the air. To combat this, for five days certain people, based on their lisecense plate number, were not allowed to use their cars. Though not everyone complied, after the five days the smog went from the levels found in the worst city for pollution, Beijing China, down by sixty percent (par.14). In just under a week Paris went from being the most polluted it had ever been to a better, safer level. If a city just by limiting the car usage by half was able to make such a drastic difference in that time, imagine it being limited more over a wider area. There is a possibility of totally correcting the pollution problem worldwide, or at least making it better and more easily handled. Although the enviroment is important, cars are also affecting the way we interact as people in a community.\\n\\nBecause we have cars, we never really see the senery around us. We exit our houses, jump in our cars, drive, and walk ito our destination. There is no contact with nature or other people passing by. Limiting cars can lead to the increase of interaction and better looking cities. In Bogota, there is a day once a year called \"car-free day\", in which no one is allowed any use of their personal cars and fined if they do not comply. Because of this there has been an increase in new high-end resturants and places to shop. The community has also added more city parks and places for sports. There is no traffic rush hour and due to the increased walking the old broken sidewalks have been replaced with larger new ones (par.28). No one wants to not only have to walk, but have to walk on a surface that is hard to walk on and unappealing. Due to this, people started to create parks and sports centers for a nice place to be as well as a nice place to look at. And because of the increased foot traffic, there have been more people opening shops and resturants, as no one speeding by in a car will notice a small corner store, but someone strolling by, taking in the scenery will. In response to the increased foot traffic, it is important that there is somewhere to actually put your foot, and old cracked pavement won\\'t cut it. If there are less cars, less road pavement is needed and more sidewalk pavement is. So, the old pavement is replaced with more pavement that is in better shape. All the walking and passing people causes people to be more social and to interact more often. The members of a community are more together. Mr. Sivak, a researcher, had noticed both of his children are not interested in getting a driver\\'s licence. Everything they do is centered around walking, public transport, and carpooling. They don\\'t find it necissary to have a car and licence (par. 39). The children of the researcher don\\'t have or need a car because what they do doesn\\'t require them to have one. They get a more full experience not being in a car all the time. In a carpool they get to socialize with friends and while walking they get an outdoor and community experience.\\n\\nIn short, cars are an easy way to get from area to area, but they are very harful to the enviroment and our community. They add pollution to the air and cut off our everyday contact. If we limited the use of cars we would lower pollution, casuse our cities to be more attractive, have better ways of transport, and be closer as people in an area. So, is a car still going to be your most common way of transport? Think of the good you would do to the world if it wasn\\'t.

Now, although this may seem like a very good and helpful thing us humans could use, it has its problems. Which is why i think we should not have driverless cars.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that I believe we should not have driverless cars is because a lot of taxi drivers would lose their jobs. Even though in the passage it says that it would use\\n\\n\"half the fuel of todays taxis\". If the cab drivers lose their jobs, we could patentially be hurting a family. Although it does not seem like a very big issue it is still a problem that comes with the car. Unemployment rates are already low. Having people lose jobs due to a car? It doesnt seem very fair to struggling families.\\n\\nAnother reason i believe we should not have driverless cars is, its patentially more dangerous. Even though the car could have more knowledge of what to do, because thats what it was made for. See the problem here is that with all of the computers involved with the car it is easy for hackers to hack into them. If a hacker messes with the computer software it could really mess up what the car was designed to do. If someones computer in the car starts to glitch and fails while driving this will end badly. Multiple wrecks could happen all at once. Just like the passage says \"if the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault\".\\n\\nOne argument a person could use is that the cars would have more knowledge about driving than an actual person would, which could be helpful in reducing car accidents. People drive wrecklessly all the time. Which yes, this is true. Think about the future though. If we have only driverless cars in the future no one would even have the slightest idea on how to drive. I am sure they would at least get the basics of driving but what if one day the computers just fail and the internet is no longer of use? People who are on the road when this could occure may die. With with this kind of problem, their would be far more fatalities than a couple of wreckless drivers on the road.\\n\\nIn conclusion I believe that we should stick to our regular cars.

Those activities help pass time while you are at sea. Also other things you can do is do your chores on the ship like cleaning the stalls where the animals stay, feeding the animlas, and watering the animals. Those are just more reasons why you should become a Seagoing Coyboy.\\n\\nAfter you read all of this I hope you decide to become a Seagoing Coyboy. Now you know how this choice is going to be adventure filled, an amazing experience for helping people, and what the things you get to do on the ship. Those are all of the reasons why I belive that you should decide coming a Seagoing Coyboy.                    \", 'score': '3', 'gpt_coherence_x': '3.0', 'gpt_fluency': '3.0', 'Line number': '16417', 'gpt_coherence_y': '5.0', 'gpt_relevance': '1.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",
      "{'inputs.question': 'In the story \"A Cowboy Who Rides the Waves\" a young adult named Luke signs up for a program that is called the \"Seagoing Cowboys\" that take care of horses, young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys do this because countries that were destroyed need them for travel and food. Now here are three reasons why Luke decided to join the Seagoing Cowboys.\\n\\nLuke signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys because it was an opportunity of a life time. That means that he would not get anymore chances to travel on a boat around the world. This is also a big opportunity mostly because he is a farm boy from a small town. In paragraph 5 and 1 it states \"... Luke couldn\\'t say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.\" \"The cattle-boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy, but besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China...\" Also Luke wanted to join because he got to help countries that were damaged from the war. In the two sentences that were right before the first paragraph (the ones that help explain the story a little bit) it states \" Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II (or WWII for short).\"\\n\\nThe last reason that Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys was because he got to be with animals. In paragraph 7 it states \" Helping out on his aunt Katie\\'s farm had prepared Luke for the hard work...\" So that means that if he worked on a farm with a lot of animals, and he joins something with animals, that means he likes animals. Also in paragraph 1 it states \" ... Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat.\" So that would mean that he wants to travel with animals in a baot or he wants to be in a boat filled with animals because he like animals (this story is kind of reminding me about Noah\\'s Arch, you know the one with the boat filled with animals because there was a giant flood).\\n\\nSo those are the reasons why Luke desided to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Remember he joined because he wanted to help countries that were damaged or destroyed in the World War II, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for him because he is a farm boy, and because he got to be with animals. That is why Luke joined the program.', 'score': '4', 'gpt_coherence_x': '3.0', 'gpt_fluency': '', 'Line number': '16426', 'gpt_coherence_y': '', 'gpt_relevance': '5.0', 'gpt_groundedness': '5.0'}\n",
